<h1>Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)</h1>
<p>This is the protocol that arduino boards use to communicate back with the
computer via <code>Serial.print()</code>.</p>
<p>The basic properties of this protocol are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's asynchronous (doesn't rely on a clock signal).</li>
<li>The speed is configurable.</li>
<li>The format is configurable.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many cases UART has been replaced by either I2C or SPI, but it is
nonetheless still used for low-speed low-throughput projects because it is very
simple and low-cost to implement given that it requires less wires/ports. More
on that later.</p>
<h2>Serial</h2>
<p>The serial class allows you to send or receive data from the computer to the
arduino, or to another device connected to the arduino via TX and RX pins.</p>
<p>The difference is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>When sending data via USB, use the <code>Serial</code> class.</li>
<li>When sending data via TX/RX pins, use the <code>Serial1</code> class.</li>
<li>Some other boards also have <code>Serial2</code> and <code>Serial3</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The UART interface available via <code>Serial</code> has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Serial.begin()</code> begins serial communication, with a specified baud rate. You
can pick either 9600 or 115200. This function is usually called during the
<code>setup()</code> function on arduino sketches.</li>
<li><code>Serial.print()</code> prints the UART data in the Serial Monitor.</li>
<li><code>Serial.printl()</code> is the same as .print() but adds a new line at the end.</li>
<li><code>Serial.available()</code> checks if serial data is available when sending commands
from the Serial Monitor.</li>
<li><code>Serial.read()</code> reads data from the serial port.</li>
<li><code>Serial.write()</code> writes data to the serial port.</li>
</ul>
<h2>UART basics</h2>
<p>UART serially sends one bit at a time. The series of bits has a starting bit,
followed by several data bits, an optional parity bit, and one or more stopping
bits.</p>
<p>Given that UART communication doesn't rely on a clock signal, it relies on a
pre-determined baud rate to figure when to send/read a bit.</p>
<p><img src="serial_vs_parallel_comms.png" alt="parallel vs sync"></p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231208204935/https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/uart">source</a></p>
<p>The advantage here is that synchronous communication only requires one wire, so
this can make your circuit cheaper and easier to manufacture.</p>
<p>Also consider that the transmitter and the receiver must have the same common
ground to be able to interpret LOW/HIGH signals with the right reference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key components of UART include the transmitter, receiver, and baud rate.
The transmitter collects data from a source, formats it into serial bits, and
sends it via a TX (Transmit) pin. The receiver receives it via a RX (Receive)
pin, processes incoming serial data and converts it into parallel data for
the host system. The baud rate determines the speed of data transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231208204935/https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/uart">source</a></p>
<h2>Baud rates</h2>
<p>Important things to know about baud rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measured in bits per second.</li>
<li>Both receivers and transmitters must agree on the value, otherwise
communication is out of sync and won't make sense.</li>
<li>The higher the baud rate, more precision is required to synchronise receiver
and transmitter. There are higher risks involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>A way to circumvent the problem from the last point is via UART Flow Control</p>
<h2>UART Flow Control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>UART Flow Control is a method for slow and fast devices to communicate with
each other over UART without the risk of losing data. Consider the case where
two units are communicating over UART. A transmitter T is sending a long
stream of bytes to a receiver R. R is a slower device than T, and R cannot
keep up. It needs to either do some processing on the data or empty some
buffers before it can keep receiving data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>R needs to tell T to stop transmitting for a while. This is where flow
control comes in. Flow control provides extra signaling to inform the
transmitter that it should stop (pause) or start (resume) the transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Several forms of flow control exist. For example, hardware flow control uses
extra wires, where the logic level on these wires define whether the
transmitter should keep sending data or stop. With software flow control,
special characters are sent over the normal data lines to start or stop the
transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231208204935/https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/uart">source</a></p>
<h2>Message format</h2>
<p><img src="uart_message_format.png" alt="uart_message_format"></p>
<p>The message starts with a <strong>start bit</strong>, which is always LOW. The receiver
starts to prepare itself for receiving a message.</p>
<p>Followed by that, the message includes the <strong>data bits</strong>. Those bits can vary
in number, and this number needs to be agreed upon by both the receiver and the
transmitter. A common length is 8 bits (1 byte), but this can vary based on the
application. This length is also referred to as <em>character size</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>parity</strong> bit is an error-checking mechanism to detect transmission
errors. A common use is to set the parity bit as 1 if the number of &quot;1&quot; bits in
the data message is odd, and 0 if it is even.</p>
<p>The <strong>stop</strong> bit marks the end of the message. The polarity may vary depending
on the system, and some times two stop bits may be applied.</p>
<h2>Sending a message to arduino from the monitor</h2>
<p>You can pop a monitor open and write characters and press enter to send them
to the arduino with the script below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;Arduino.h&gt;

char incomingByte = 0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);

    incomingByte = Serial.read();
    Serial.print(&quot;received: &quot;);
    // Print byte in decimal.
    if (incomingByte == '\n') {
      Serial.println(&quot;\\n&quot;);
    } else {
      Serial.println(incomingByte);
    }

    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  }
}
</code></pre>
