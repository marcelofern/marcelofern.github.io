## Answer

We will first need the function that implement the square-root algorithm:

```scm
(define (average x y)
        (/ (+ x y) 2)
)

(define (improve guess x)
        (average guess (/ x guess))
)

(define (square x)
        (* x x)
)

(define (good-enough? guess x)
        (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001)
)

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
        (if (good-enough? guess x)
            guess
            (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)
        )
)

(define (sqrt x)
        (sqrt-iter 1.0 x)
)
```

Let's try first to check the result for a few small numbers:

```scm
; The value for this square root is 0.2529...
(sqrt 0.064)
; 0.25311115862564304

; The error above is somehow tolerable, but
; what happens if we go with even smaller
; numbers? The result is expected to be
; 0.08 exactly.
(sqrt 0.0064)
; 0.08095136013810225

; Still not bad, so we'll go further.
; The real result for the square root
; below should be 0.02529...
(sqrt 0.00064)
; 0.037790493135637745

; We stop here, as this is a bit off the range.
```

The above happens because the precision we've chosen for the `good-enough?`
procedure is only 0.001, so it doesn't go far enough to find a more precise
value.

Let's see how the square-root of large numbers performs.

```scm
; The below never finishes to run in my machine.
(sqrt 1999249294194921451)
```

In the case of a large number like the above, the procedure remains in an
infinite loop because whatever value is chosen will never provide the 0.001
threshold as floating numbers have limited precision.

Finding the proper implementation for this function is hard and there is
lengthy discussion in this forum post below:
