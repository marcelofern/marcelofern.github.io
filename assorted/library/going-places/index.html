<h1>Review</h1>
<p>Here're some of the pertinent quotes I found from this book:</p>
<blockquote>The international evidence makes it clear that whether aggregate supply or</blockquote>
<blockquote>demand effects dominate depends very much on the characteristics of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>migrants and the labour markets they enter. For example, a former member of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bank of England's Monetary Policy Comitte, David Blanchflower, argues that</blockquote>
<blockquote>migration reduced British inflation pressures during the mid 2000s. He says</blockquote>
<blockquote>aggregate supply effects dominated there during that period because the</blockquote>
<blockquote>majority of migrants planned to return home within two years, so they saved</blockquote>
<blockquote>most of their earnings and did not contribute much to demand. We conclude that,</blockquote>
<blockquote>in New Zealand, the quality and diversity of migrants matters more than their</blockquote>
<blockquote>raw numbers when it comes to overall economic impact.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>We see growing arrivals from Asia in the migration numbers, and we see even</blockquote>
<blockquote>more pronounced changes in New Zealand's goods trade. Both reflect growing</blockquote>
<blockquote>Asian economic influence, and in particular the economic rise of China. China</blockquote>
<blockquote>is now NZ's largest trading partner for imports and exports of goods. It is</blockquote>
<blockquote>also one of the top five sources of migrants for Australia, Canada, and the US</blockquote>
<blockquote>as well as New Zealand, and the main source of foreign-born students in the US,</blockquote>
<blockquote>UK, Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. (...) Along with the growth in</blockquote>
<blockquote>trade with Asia, there has been a relative reduction in the importance of trade</blockquote>
<blockquote>with other places, especially the US.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>Research into the impact of migration on the housing market has produced</blockquote>
<blockquote>unusual results. One study for the Reserve Bank by Andrew Coleman and John</blockquote>
<blockquote>Landon-Lane found that in the short term a net migration gain equal to 1 per</blockquote>
<blockquote>cent of the population raised house prices by about 10 per cent at the national</blockquote>
<blockquote>level. Later work for the Bank by Chris McDonald found a 1 per cent increase in</blockquote>
<blockquote>the population caused an 8 per cent increase in house prices over the following</blockquote>
<blockquote>three years, with increasing arrivals having more effect than reducing</blockquote>
<blockquote>departures.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>British economic geographers Max Nathan and Neil Lee provide evidence from</blockquote>
<blockquote>London that more diverse teams are more innovative.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>In a recent paper by Giovanni Peri and others say that STEM workers are the</blockquote>
<blockquote>main drivers of productivity growth in the US, and that immigrant STEM workers</blockquote>
<blockquote>in particular have had a significant positive impact on productiviy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Separately, Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle report that</blockquote>
<blockquote>immigrant graduate students patent at double the rate of their American-born</blockquote>
<blockquote>colleagues, reflecting the fact that immigrants disproportionately hold science</blockquote>
<blockquote>and engineering degrees.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>In NZ, Stillman and Mare found that university-qualified migrants achieved wage</blockquote>
<blockquote>and emplyment outcomes similar to those of locals more quickly than less</blockquote>
<blockquote>skilled migrants did.</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>In theory, competition for jobs from migrants could increase unemployment or</blockquote>
<blockquote>reduce wages for existing workers. But the evidence is that any detrimental</blockquote>
<blockquote>impacts on existing resident's employment or wages are small and short-term.</blockquote>
