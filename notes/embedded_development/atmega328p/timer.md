## Intro and important terms

- The ATMega328p has 3 timers, all of them have PWM support, and they are named
  by a number: timer 0, timer 1, timer 2.
- Both timer 0 and 2 are 8 bit timers, only timer 1 is 16 bits.
- The counter value can be accessed via register `TCNTn` (n=0,1,2).

## Timer/Counter 0

The following are details about operation mode of timer/counter 0.
The are few differences between the timers, but most of the content below is
generalisable.

### Normal mode

In this mode, the counter always go up (incremental instead of decremental),
and no counter clear is performed. The counter value is simply wrapped when it
reach the maximum (255) back to zero.

This mode is set when the waveform generation mode value is WGM02:0 = 0.

### Fast PWM mode

In this mode, a high frequency PWM waveform generation is available.
The counter counts from BOTTOM to TOP then restarts from BOTTOM. TOP is defined
as 0xFF when WGM2:0 = 3, and OCR0A when WGM2:0 = 7.

The PWM frequency for the output can be calculated by the following equation:

`f_pwm = f_clk / (N*256)`

For the 16bit timer this becomes:

`f_pwm = f_clk / (N*(1+TOP))

N is a pre-scale value that can be configured (1, 8, 64, 256, or 1024).

This mode is set when the waveform generation mode value is WGM02:0 = 3 or 7.

- `TCCR1A`: Timer/Counter1 Control Register A.
- `TCCR1B`: Timer/Counter1 Control Register B.
- `CS12`: Clock select. A value of 1 << CS12 | 1 << CS10, gives clk/1024
  (from prescaler) which is 16Mhz/1024 == 15,625hz.
