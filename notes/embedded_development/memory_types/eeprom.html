<blockquote>
<p>In microcontroller-based systems, Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, or
EEPROM, is also part of its ROM; actually, Flash memory is a type of EEPROM.
The main difference between Flash memory and EEPROM is how they are managed;
EEPROM can be managed at the byte level (write or erased) while Flash can be
managed at the block level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be pedantic, FLASH memory is merely a form of EEPROM: There is a marketing
/ branding aspect here. Typically, the distinction used today is that EEPROMS
are single-byte (or storage word) erasable / rewritable, while FLASH is
block-based for erase/write operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Relevant to the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>EEPROMs continue to be popular due to maximum erase/write cycle ratings
being an order of magnitude or two better than FLASH</li>
<li>Due to investments in design typically having been amortized over time, as
with any mature technology, the cost of production and testing reduces
compared to a newer technology.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of write cycles most EEPROMs can handle generally far exceeds the
number of write cycles most flash memory can handle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>EEPROMS can generally handle ~100,000-1,000,000 writes per cell. Flash is
generally rated to ~1,000-100,000 writes (it varies heavily depending on the
type of flash).</p>

<p>Main differences between EEPROM and Flash:</p>
<h2>EEPROM</h2>
<ul>
<li>Erase Mechanism: EEPROM allows individual bytes or words to be erased and
rewritten electrically.</li>
<li>Write Mechanism: EEPROM can be written byte-by-byte, offering more
flexibility for small changes compared to Flash.</li>
<li>Speed: EEPROM generally has slower write and erase speeds compared to Flash
memory.</li>
<li>Endurance: EEPROM typically has a higher endurance compared to Flash memory,
with tens of thousands to millions of erase/write cycles.</li>
<li>Usage: EEPROM is often used in applications requiring frequent and small data
updates, such as in embedded systems for storing configuration data or
firmware updates.</li>
<li>Cost: EEPROM tends to be more expensive on a per-bit basis compared to Flash
memory due to its lower storage density.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flash</h2>
<ul>
<li>Erase Mechanism: Flash memory erases data in blocks, which means larger
sections of memory are erased at once. It is organized into blocks, pages,
and sectors.</li>
<li>Write Mechanism: Flash memory requires data to be written in pages, which are
larger than the typical byte-sized writes in EEPROM.</li>
<li>Speed: Flash memory generally offers faster write and erase speeds compared
to EEPROM.</li>
<li>Endurance: Flash memory typically has a limited number of erase/write cycles,
which can be a few thousand to hundreds of thousands depending on the type
and quality.</li>
<li>Usage: Flash memory is commonly used in mass storage devices like USB drives,
memory cards, and solid-state drives (SSDs) due to its higher storage
capacity and faster access times.</li>
<li>Cost: Flash memory is generally more cost-effective for larger storage
capacities compared to EEPROM.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AVR example</h2>
<p>Here's how to declare a variable in the EEPROM memory, and how to read/write
to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;avr/eeprom.h&gt;

// Use the EEMEM macro.
uint8_t EEMEM my_variable = 0x12;

// Read data using eeprom_read_byte.
uint8_t value = eeprom_read_byte(&amp;my_variable);

uint8_t new_value = 0xAB;
// Write data using eeprom_write_byte.
eeprom_write_byte(&amp;my_variable, new_value);

printf(&quot;my_variable: %d&quot;, value);
// my_variable: 171
</code></pre>
