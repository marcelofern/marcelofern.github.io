<h2>Goodbye ZSH</h2>
<p>After 7 years using
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240503162424/https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240501165521/https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a>, I've
completely ditched both of them today.</p>
<p>I would like to state at the top that there isn't anything inherently bad or
wrong with zsh and oh-my-zsh. It is just that these technologies don't fit well
within my way of doing things, and have become unnecessary over time.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, but I will start with the reasons for getting
rid of <code>oh-my-zsh</code> first.</p>
<h2>oh-my-zsh</h2>
<p>One may think that oh-my-zsh is zsh itself, but that is not true.
oh-my-zsh is simply a plugin manager for zsh.</p>
<p>The oh-my-zsh package promises wonders. From their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one!</p>
<p>Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town or your
money back! With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage
of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come
up to you in caf√©s and ask you, &quot;that is amazing! are you some sort of
genius?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh-my-zsh comes with hundreds of plugins pre-installed, many of which you will
never use or hear of, and that includes themes as well.</p>
<p>Even though this isn't a problem in itself, as those plugins are just text
files that will hang around in your system, they are still there when you
didn't ask for them. This is something that I personally have been trying to
reduce in my system.</p>
<p>A more important problem, is around bash <code>aliases</code> that oh-my-zsh brings with
it. Many of each are for applications you may not even have installed.</p>
<p>For example, these are some of the aliases available with oh-my-zsh:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">alias help='man'
alias _='sudo '
alias :3='echo'
alias dud='du -d 1 -h'
alias drm='docker container rm'
alias p='ps -f'
alias rm='rm -i'
alias ldot='ls -ld .*'
alias lS='ls -1FSsh'
alias hadat='heroku addons:attach'
</code></pre>
<p>This might not be a problem unless you have a crashing alias. But still, did
you know you had all those aliases available? Are them really that useful to
you? Have you come across them accidentally and become surprised?</p>
<p>Even if some aliases or plugins are useful, you can copy the ones you want, and
just plug into your <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>
<p>In the end of the day oh-my-zsh plugins are just bash files written in zsh
syntax, many of which are compatible with plain bash, or can be easily ported.</p>
<p>There is no versioning control or anything fancy like that. Just files.</p>
<p>For me it came down to: I don't need this technology, and it does not add much
value to my daily use of my computer, therefore it should go.</p>
<p>Next are the reasons why I stopped using zsh.</p>
<h2>zsh</h2>
<p>One thing that people aren't really aware of is that zsh doubles as a scripting
language of its own. They might not realise this until they share a script with
someone, and that script doesn't run on their machine.</p>
<p>For example, the syntax below is only available in zsh:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># All files that are NOT .c files (^ provides negation)
ls -d ^*.c

# Grouping
ls (foo|bar).*

# Recursive search with **
ls **/*bar
</code></pre>
<p>There are more advanced filename-generation patterns, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>zsh also allows you to <code>cd</code> into a directory just by typing its name</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">% cd /
% setopt autocd
% bin
% pwd
/bin
</code></pre>
<p>One very good feature is that zsh allows you to turn vi mode on via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">bindkey -v
</code></pre>
<p>We will talk more about this later.</p>
<p>The official introduction page has a lot more examples of what is available.
You can check it <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240503012616/https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Intro/intro_toc.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the vim mode, I must say that I'm not very keen on any of the extra
functionalities.</p>
<p>More over, some functionalities like expanding <code>/u/lo/b</code> to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
are things that I do not want to have and strike me as bad patterns.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem for me is that the zsh scripting language adds way too
many non-POSIX compliant features that end up confusing me. I always have to
look up the syntax to make sure my zsh script isn't going to be flawed in
another environment that doesn't use zsh due to invalid syntax errors.</p>
<p>This type of problem is more pronounced for me because I have several bash
scripts that I created overtime with zsh scripting not even knowing I was using
zsh scripting. This is a common newbie mistake to make, but when you just want
to get something going you often get into these types trade-offs that become
more pronounced later once you have mastered a few tools.</p>
<p>So what is the alternative to all of this?</p>
<h2>bash</h2>
<p>Yep. I'm just using raw bash now and trying to figure out how far I can get
with it. So far I haven't got a reason to get anything more featureful.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have been using <code>fzf</code>, which is a dependency I already had and
am familiar with, to deal with autocompletion and recursive command search
instead. The experience is much better than the zsh autocompletion.</p>
<p>Adding these lines to your .bashrc:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">source /usr/share/fzf/key-bindings.bash
source /usr/share/fzf/completion.bash
</code></pre>
<p>Will enable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+t list files+folders in current directory (e.g., type git add , press
Ctrl+t, select a few files using Tab, finally Enter)</li>
<li>Ctrl+r search history of shell commands</li>
<li>Alt+c fuzzy change directory</li>
</ul>
<p>This is handy for me, as the functionality is similar to the <code>Telescope</code> plugin
I have been using in neovim.</p>
<p>And on that note, I have been using alacritty as my terminal.
Alacritty has vi key bindings, so I don't need my shell to provide that for me.</p>
<p>Most terminal emulator have some form of emacs or vi key bindings these days,
so this isn't something necessary for a shell to support.</p>
<p>That is pretty much it, nothing fancy - just getting rid of new technology that
doesn't aggregate value in my day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>I'm on a journey to make my installation script as lean as possible to make
updating my system as fast as possible, and also to give my system less
entrypoints to break or be exploited.</p>
<p>Granted, I haven't had any bad experiences with zsh, but that alone doesn't
mean I should re-check my previous assumptions and switch a particular
technology for something better (or just pick the boring tech that has always
been there to begin with).</p>
