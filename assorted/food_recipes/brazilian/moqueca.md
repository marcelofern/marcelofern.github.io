# Moqueca Vegana (Evie's Recipe) 🫑🍅🥥🍠

## Sauce
- 2-4 red capsicums (roasted, de-skinned, blended until smooth)
- 1 can tomatoes (crushed and sieved or blend until smooth)
- 1/2 - 2/3 can coconut milk (or just use a bit less coconut cream and add
  water if necessary)
- 2-4 tsp sweet and/or smoked paprika (or just do to your taste)
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
- 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp white pepper
- Black pepper to taste
- 1-2 tsp sugar (to taste)
- Salt to taste (~1-2 tsp?)
- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce

## Vegetables (can use what’s in the fridge / seasonal) I used:
- Green capsicum
- Onion (optional but nice)
- Cauliflower
- Green beans
- Zucchini
- Kūmara
- Pumpkin
- banana da terra (plantain)

You could also use:

- Mushrooms
- Carrot
- Broccoli
- Aubergine
- Spinach
- Tofu
- Palm heart
- Potato
- Or just whatever else you feel like!

## Method:

- Cook the red capsicum, peel, and blend until smooth. Set aside.
- Chop veggies and add to pan (with olive oil) in order of longest to shortest
  cooking time. If doing root veggies, suggest steaming or roasting separately
  and adding at the end so they don’t take too long in the pan and your other
  veggies don’t get soggy waiting for them to cook.
- Once veggies about halfway cooked, add sweet paprika, white pepper, chilli
  flakes, turmeric, and a few scrunches of black pepper.
- Cook for 1-2 minutes, then start adding liquid - blend tomatoes and add, add
  capsicum sauce, and coconut milk. (If using tofu, would add here).
- Cook until begins to simmer, then add sugar, salt, and soy sauce to get the
  flavour balance.
- Once the veggies are tender, serve with rice, farofa, etc! ☺️
