## Definition

If `a` and `b` are positive integers, then there exist integers `k` and `l`
such that: `gcd(a, b) = ak + bl`.

## Examples

```
  gcd(12,20) = 4
  gcd(12,20) = 12k + 20l
  gcd(12,20) = 12*2 + 20*-1
  k = 2, l = -1

  gcd(12,20) = 4
  gcd(12,20) = 12k + 20l
  gcd(12,20) = 12*-3 + 20*2
  k = -3, l = 2
```

In fact there are infinite solutions. But only one suffices for the theorem.
