<h1>Code Reviews In Vim</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-11-21
</code></pre>
<p>A common way of reviewing code today is by performing the review using the
repository host UI (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).</p>
<p>I have done that for awhile, and I still do it when code changes are trivial.</p>
<p>&quot;Trivial&quot; means I don't need to play with the branch locally first to have
confidence the changes are correct.</p>
<p>However, often I will work with code that is hard to &quot;only see&quot; and feel
confident it does the right thing.</p>
<p>For more complex cases, having the branch locally allows me to inspect and
alter the code better than I can using the repository host UI.</p>
<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>The first step is to get the branch locally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git fetch origin branch_name &amp;&amp; git checkout branch_name
</code></pre>
<p>You can simplify this command and skip to <code>git checkout</code> if you always fetch
the entire remote (which I don't do because it takes too much space/time).</p>
<h2>Showing the commits</h2>
<p>The next step is to find exactly which commits the new branch includes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git log -p master..HEAD
</code></pre>
<p>This command basically means &quot;show me all the commits that this branch (HEAD)
introduced since it diverged from master&quot;.</p>
<p>This effectively shows the commits created by the branch author and nothing
else.</p>
<p>The <code>-p</code> (patches) includes the diffs for each commit in the result. I skip
this sometimes if I am visualising the patches in a different way.</p>
<p>When in Vim, I use the vim-fugitive plugin. Running the same command through
the plugin wrapper gives me a quick-fix window containing the commits from the
pull request.</p>
<p>Running <code>:Gclog master..HEAD</code> looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="gclog.png" alt="gclog.png"></p>
<p>Now I can quickly navigate between commits to see what's changed.</p>
<p>If you are using a different tool but still want to see the commit changes in
your editor, you can try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git show &lt;commit_hash&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Checking Out Each Commit</h2>
<p>I currently work on codebases that use atomic commits.
This essentially means that for each commit:</p>
<ol>
<li>The test suite must fully pass.</li>
<li>The integrity of the codebase isn't in jeopardy (no half-done changes
between commits).</li>
<li>The codebase is in a deployable state.</li>
<li>A commit explains a single change, not multiple.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a commit title &quot;Change X <strong>and</strong> Y&quot; is an indication that the
commit isn't atomic. Multiple things are changing in the same commit.</p>
<p>Having atomic commits means that I can code-review a Pull Request
commit-by-commit.</p>
<p>Of course there are many more benefits of this practice. For example, I can use
<code>git blame</code> effectively. No change will be part of a 40-commits rebased
branch with lack of detailed explanation in the commit description.</p>
<p>So after I have run <code>git log -p master..HEAD</code>, I will go through each commit
and perform:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Checkout the relevant commit I want to play with
git checkout &lt;commit hash&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If I have messed things up, I can just check the reflog and go back to the
place where I got the branch from.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># List the &quot;reference logs&quot; to find the record when the tip of the branch
# reference changed.

git reflog

# Now go back to the hash representing the time I checked the branch at the
# first time. It will look something like:
# 43c0eb3 HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from main to my_branch

git checkout 43c0eb3
</code></pre>
<h2>Taking Notes</h2>
<p>If I am reviewing a complicated branch, I will usually open a new file in the
<code>/tmp/</code> folder to take some notes in.</p>
<p>There isn't anything fancy about that. It comes from the principle of wanting
to have vim-editing capabilities when writing down a comment on a pull request.</p>
<p>Often, I will write code blocks in reply to a commit anyway, so editing
comments in vim makes it easier to edit the comment than say, the GitHub UI.</p>
<p>Note: There are ways to embed vim into a browser nowadays, but it often feels
strange. I prefer to not use an embedded vim.</p>
