## Introduction

When someone is "ricing" their unix system, they are making functional and
visual customisations to their desktop. These changes could be anything from
changing the colour of a status bar to completely restructuring their computer
environment.

_**Why?**_

These are my main reasons:

- **Productivity**: You can customise your applications and keyboard shortcuts
  to satisfy your work-flow.
- **Performance**: You are in control of what gets installed on your
  application and not have to worry about unknown apps running on the
  background.
- **Privacy**: It is your system and the defaults in some distributions
  can contain software that can spy on your behaviour like Canonical has done
  in the past.
- **Visual Satisfaction**: Whatever colour scheme you like.
- **Because it is fun**.

## How does it look like?

## Softwares used

### arch linux

Arch gives the user a minimal operational system, delegating responsibility of
most of the packages installation to the user. I.e, no batteries included.

An OK understanding of linux is necessary to use this distro, you trully don't
need much more than being confortable around the terminal these days. This is
because everything you need to learn is already in the arch wiki.

Some of the perks of using arch are:

- Rolling releases
- Rich user repository (AUR)
- The fantastic Arch wiki
- No corporations behind it (community support only)
- Helpful community

### i3-gaps

i3-gaps is a fork of the i3wm (tilling window manager) for X11. Instead of
having stacked windows that overlap (like in microsoft windows, or macOs),
windows are organized side-by-side as default, having gaps between them.
The benefits are:

- Able to customise keyboard shortcuts to navigate through windows.
- Easy to setup.

### polybar

Polybar is was the easiest and most user-friendly status bar I could find. With
a lot of pre-configured setups and out-of-the-box integrations, getting up to
speed is very simple.

### rofi

A very simple and configurable application/script launcher.

### pywal

For setting colours and themes.

## More about Ricing

When it comes to finding inspiration for ricing in linux, a good place to look
at is [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). Most of my setup came
from picking apart different rices that users have shared in that channel. It
is also a good place to visit once in a while to stay up-to-date with what the
rest of the community is using.
