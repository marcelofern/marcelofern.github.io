<h1>uptime</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-11-12
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ uptime
 15:37:23 up 12 min,  2 users,  load average: 1.02, 1.01, 0.67
</code></pre>
<p>uptime(1): Tell how long the system has been running.</p>
<p>This is a simple tool that returns a one-liner with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current time.</li>
<li>How long the system has been running for.</li>
<li>The number of users currently logged on.</li>
<li><strong>The system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The explanation for load averages is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a
runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either
using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state
is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken
over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the
number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system
is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of
the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analogously, if the load average is 10 for a system with 2 CPUs, it means that
2 processes are running while 8 are waiting (on average).</p>
<p>Analogy from the Performance book (Gregg):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a car toll plaza: you could measure the load at various points during
the day by counting how many cars were being serviced (utilisation) plus how
many cars were queued (saturation).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What can uptime be used for</h2>
<p>If the load is increasing over time, it is an indication that a problem
affecting CPU performance is scaling.</p>
<p>If it is decreasing, it might mean that you missed the performance bottleneck
event!</p>
