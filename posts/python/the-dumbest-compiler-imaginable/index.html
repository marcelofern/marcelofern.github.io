<h1>The Dumbest Compiler Imaginable</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-08-20

<blockquote>
<p>Python is about having the simplest, dumbest compiler imaginable, and the
official runtime semantics actively discourage cleverness in the compiler
like parallelizing loops or turning recursions into loops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>âˆ’ Guido van Rossum (creator of Python). <a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=bIxWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22Python+is+about+having+the+simplest,+dumbest+compiler+imaginable.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2OfDoWX321&amp;sig=ACfU3U32jKZBE3VkJ0gvkKbxRRgD0bnoRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Python%20is%20about%20having%20the%20simplest%2C%20dumbest%20compiler%20imaginable.%22&amp;f=false">source</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This might be a shocking statement to read for someone used to languages that
compile to machine code directly like C, C++, Zig, Rust, etc.</p>
<p>The compiler is, usually, a major source of optimisation for human-written
code, being capable of lexically analysing code and removing unnecessary
computation.</p>
<p>This basically allows developers to write whatever code they think is the most
readable and expressive, while handing over the work of optimising the actual
code to the compiler.</p>
<p>A classic example in C is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int foo() {
  int bar1 = 42; // Unused variable.
  int bar2 = 100;
  return bar2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which when compiled with the most basic level of optimisation via <code>gcc -O1</code>
produces the following assembly code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">foo:
  mov  eax, 100
  ret
</code></pre>
<p>The function just returns the value 100. There is no use of the stack to
store values, no load operation to fetch variables, and no other form of
allocations. The compiler is able to reason that the code returns 100 and
thus creates the machine code to do just that.</p>
<p>Compare this with the Python function below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    bar1 = 42
    bar2 = 100
    return bar2
</code></pre>
<p>Which returns the following bytecode via <code>dis.dis(foo)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>LOAD_CONST               1 (42)
STORE_FAST               0 (bar1)
LOAD_CONST               2 (100)
STORE_FAST               1 (bar2)
LOAD_FAST                1 (bar2)
RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>bar1</code> variable hasn't been discarded, even though it hasn't been used by
the code. A full description of Python opcodes is provided in the official
documentation
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240820032050/https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html">(source)</a>,
but basically the instructions above do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LOAD_CONST</strong>: Pushes the value 42 onto the stack. The big switch case in
CPython uses this underlying C code:<pre><code class="language-c">        TARGET(LOAD_CONST) {
            frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr;
            next_instr += 1;
            INSTRUCTION_STATS(LOAD_CONST);
            _PyStackRef value;
            value = PyStackRef_FromPyObjectNew(GETITEM(FRAME_CO_CONSTS, oparg));
            stack_pointer[0] = value;
            stack_pointer += 1;
            assert(WITHIN_STACK_BOUNDS());
            DISPATCH();
        }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>STORE_FAST</strong>: Pops the last value of the stack (42) into the local variable
(bar1).<pre><code class="language-c">      TARGET(STORE_FAST) {
          frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr;
          next_instr += 1;
          INSTRUCTION_STATS(STORE_FAST);
          _PyStackRef value;
          value = stack_pointer[-1];
          SETLOCAL(oparg, value);
          stack_pointer += -1;
          assert(WITHIN_STACK_BOUNDS());
          DISPATCH();
      }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>LOAD_FAST</strong>: Pushes a reference to bar2 onto the stack.<pre><code class="language-c">      TARGET(LOAD_FAST) {
          frame-&gt;instr_ptr = next_instr;
          next_instr += 1;
          INSTRUCTION_STATS(LOAD_FAST);
          _PyStackRef value;
          assert(!PyStackRef_IsNull(GETLOCAL(oparg)));
          value = PyStackRef_DUP(GETLOCAL(oparg));
          stack_pointer[0] = value;
          stack_pointer += 1;
          assert(WITHIN_STACK_BOUNDS());
          DISPATCH();
      }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>RETURN_VALUE</strong>: pops the stack, returning the value (bar2) back to the
caller. (C code is too long to add here).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that those operations aren't light on CPU time nor on store/loads. But,
that is Python, so there's no much we can do there.</p>
<p>As comparison, this is what a function returning 100 would do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    return 100
</code></pre>
<pre><code>RETURN_CONST             1 (100)
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, a bytecode optimiser could generate the disassembled version of our
code above once it analysed the function to always return the same constant
value. This type of optimisation is called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240820050751/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">Peephole
Optimisation</a>,
a term coined back in 1965.</p>
<p>The problem of optimising the snippet above seems simple, but one immediate
problem is Python's dynamic-typed nature. It isn't trivial to know whether an
operation has been overloaded or not, but if we could tell the compiler
&quot;I haven't overloaded anything for these classes&quot; we could possibly have some
nice optimisations.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://legacy.python.org/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/montanaro/montanaro.html">interesting paper</a> from 1998 has a lot to say about optimising Python bytecode.</p>
<p>For example, one snippet provided in the paper above talks about a common
unpacking pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a,b,c = 1,2,3
</code></pre>
<p>Which in current versions of Python generates the bytecode:</p>
<pre><code>LOAD_CONST               0 ((1, 2, 3))
UNPACK_SEQUENCE          3
STORE_NAME               0 (a)
STORE_NAME               1 (b)
STORE_NAME               2 (c)
RETURN_CONST             1 (None)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is less desirable than the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
</code></pre>
<p>Which skips the tuple allocation and unpacking overhead, dealing with variables
directly stored in the stack:</p>
<pre><code>LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
STORE_NAME               0 (a)
LOAD_CONST               1 (2)
STORE_NAME               1 (b)
LOAD_CONST               2 (3)
STORE_NAME               2 (c)
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, Python tuples are immutable, and thus can be loaded as
constants. That's why the LOAD_CONST opcode managed to load the three values
in one chunk.</p>
<p>There are several other examples of optimisation opportunities, but the key
question is: <em>Why isn't CPython already doing those</em>?</p>
<p>Guido's quote provided at the top of this post isn't sufficient to elucidate
what perks we are getting from having an unoptimised bytecode compiler. One
obvious one is maintainability. A dumb compiler is way easier to maintain and
change than a smart compiler that optimises a lot.</p>
<p>I know that compiler experts will say that provided the right compiler
architecture, pattern-matching optimisation becomes easy as such optimisations
can be injected as &quot;plugins&quot;. Since I am not a compiler expert I have no
way to validate this idea. All I have is Guido's quote.</p>
<p>I am not particularly found on having simplicity on the compiler at the expense
of all Python programs being slowed down because of it. But maybe if Python had
an optimiser for bytecode, Python wouldn't have existed in the first place.</p>
<p>It seems like the tides have been changing though as Python 3.13 will get a
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240718182110/https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html">JIT</a>.</p>
<p>Another perk from a dumb compiler is debugging. Written Python code directly
translates into bytecode, and thus we can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    a = 10
    breakpoint()
    b = 20
    return b
</code></pre>
<p>In the process of debugging we know that the variable <code>a</code> is there and won't
be optimised away. However... This is a bit of a straw man argument as we
could generate the bytecode with different levels of optimisation as in
<code>gcc</code>'s -O1, -O2, and -O3, thus using a lower level of optimisation when
debugging.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Outro</h2>
<p>It is important to note that there have been many attempts to make Python
faster, many of which have failed [<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3146/">1</a>]
[<a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston">2</a>].</p>
<p>As much as it would be nice to have another Python interpreter fully JIT'ed and
full of bytecode optimisations, in reality it is really hard to compete against
CPython. Many 3rd-party libraries use CPython's C-extensions directly, which
aren't necessarily available in other Python interpreters (excluding some
forks), rendering such libraries unusable.</p>
<p>It might be too far to say that Python is a mono-implementation language, but
it does feel like it. If a fork is successful it will be merged up-stream. If
the interpreter itself is built without CPython's C-extensions in mind, it will
not provide a rich ecosystem for all the performance-dependent 3rd-party libs
out there.</p>
