# Review: One Hundred Years of Solitude

I picked up this book because it's a classic, and because it is a by-product of
South America - So I had to check what that was all about.

I found the beginning of the book interesting, and engaging. Mysterious, even.
But as the story developed and the millions of Aurelio Buen Dias populated the
plot, I quickly lost interest and lost track of what was going on. It does not
surprise me that some people dedicate a great amount of time studying the Buen
Dias family tree to get hold of the story plot.

I can see the appeal of the book. It is a book of its own with heavy loads of
surrealism, but I grew to realise that's not something I am too much interested
in at present.
