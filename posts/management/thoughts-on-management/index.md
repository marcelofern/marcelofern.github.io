# Thoughts on 3 years of management

I've been managing people for the past 3 years at my current job. This is
not extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager at best.

As I reflect on my journey so far, I talk through lessons learnt from managing
other developers and on reoccurring patterns I have observed.

Now, a post about management is not cringe enough unless there is an "advice
top list" that summarises my current thinking. The one I could come up with is
made of 5 **must's**.

1. You must facilitate.
2. You must take an active interest in the development of your reports.
3. You must reassure through real recognition.
4. You must listen.
5. You must keep an open mind about your own management skills.

Note: Having innate charisma would be of great help as it would make it easier
to perform most of these points. However, the typical nerdy type is not usually
charismatic. We need to work harder on it. More on that later.

## You Must Facilitate

Being promoted to manager after performing well as a developer is a regular
occurrence in many companies. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to not be good at managing their peers.

Promoting a good developer has many positives. It does ensure that the new
manager won't be a mere conduit for communication. Having experience in the
field will help them facilitate (at least) the technical discussions.

However, The Venn diagram intersection between skills required to be a good
developer and to be a good manager is a narrow one. Facilitation skills may not
regularly feature on the good-developer skill set as much as it should.

My first challenge stepping into the role was to manage my own conflicts of
interest on wanting to keep coding along with a lack of guidance and experience
on how to manage other developers.

I wanted to continue progressing on my coding skills as I deemed my
individual-contributor skills more important than management and leadership.

That meant that I wasn't facilitating much. The lack of leadership and
direction quickly hampered the development of one of my teams.

Once that team grew to about ~7 developers the situation became unsustainable.

I wasn't having enough quality time to spend on important coding tasks because
I was constantly spending time on management duties. At the same time I wasn't
helping to unblock my team's work as well as I could since I spent too much
time coding.

By my sheer luck the team was independent enough to perform well even without
strong management guidance. That could equally have been the other way around.

I had to step back and rethink my approach so that I could balance facilitation
duties against coding responsibilities.

Being **proactive** about facilitating helped me save time for myself and to
relieve stress from my team. It may sound cliché, but it is true that finding
problems before they happen and answering the questions before they are
asked are important to help reduce the stress level across your team.

However, the most important thing was coming to the realisation that unblocking
7 people and letting them do good work was much more important than me, as a
single contributor, being able to write some code some of the time.

This didn't make my work easier though, there are many ways to facilitate
progress, and some situations are harder than others.

The easiest kinds of facilitation are the ones defined as a technical problem
posed by the product being developed. For example, the product manager asks for
a feature but the details aren't clear enough for a developer to jump on the
task. You pop a meeting with the product manager and the client, and together
you clear up requirements so that a developer is not stuck with vague
requirements and lack of direction.

The goal in these situations isn't to detail the design for the solution (the
developer will do that), but to make sure requirements are understood and that
there is a definition of what "done" means in the context of that task.

These facilitations aren't hard. They only take time and organising.
I.e., getting the relevant people together in a meeting, and taking the time to
properly write up details of what has been discussed and agreed.

My experience as a developer helped greatly in these areas. I was used to going
to client meetings and explaining what was possible versus what was not
possible before becoming a manager. I was also frequently helping clients with
estimations backed up by knowledge of the tech and current architecture of the
project. With those two things this type of facilitation becomes "the easier
kind".

The hardest kinds of facilitation happen when a team member is having a hard
time either because of external factors or because of conflicts between
colleagues. This is the real human-factor part of the job. I have little
experience on this.

These situations seem to take a lot of time and energy to solve. Each situation
of this type is different and facilitation might have to be defined on a
case-by-case basis.

The tools available by the business will be relevant here and the manager needs
to be aware of them to put them to good use. E.g., unlimited leave, team
rotation, mental-health days, external mediation, etc.

My only general observation is to treat the situation with compassion and
empathy. In the end of the day a manager will be dealing with people-problems
frequently. In the eyes of the person being troubled, their problems are going
to be more concerning than they may be comfortable telling you. You are at the
risk of miss-characterising the problem if you don't handle it well.

There is little point in trying to play a hard hand by being an authoritarian
manager that only dictates solutions without taking the time to care and
understand the situation i.e. _"it's your job, just do it!"_. This almost
always goes wrong and makes the manager lose the respect of their team, even
from the people not involved in the situation. Luckily this is something I
learned from observation and not from direct experience.

## You Must Take An Active Interest In The Development Of Your Reports

Of all the "musts", this is the one that took me the longest to think and write
about. It's hard to find a recipe for what "taking an active interest" is, even
though most people have a good intuition about what this phrase means.

Different people need different things depending on where they are at their
careers, what they want to achieve, and who they are.

The first step is understanding what each report needs based on their career
stage, goals, and personality. But there is a meta step here too. Both you and
the report need to be willing to learn and improve together for that
relationship to work and those questions to be answered. It's not just about
the report's growth but also the manager's willingness to evolve in response to
their team's needs.

In the best manager-managed relationships I've had **both** people were
learning together what they needed from each other and what they could provide.

To use an analogy from pedagogy theory:

> Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher
> cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with
> students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but
> one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while
> being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in
> which all grow − Paulo Freire.

Having a manager that allows themselves to not know but are comfortable asking
dumb questions is a **great thing**. I have had managers on the other side of
the spectrum who pretended to be acquainted with things they had no clue about
because they were insecure about showing potential shortcomings to their
reports. This strikes me as a **bad thing**.

It is difficult to provide quality help to develop a report's career if the
manager is not an **active** member of the team in some capacity.

It is hard to relate to the work of a report if you have no skin in the game.

This is why I am in favour of managers that get their hands dirty on the
factory line at least some of the time, even if only on smaller tasks.

This helps building team spirit and camaraderie. Frankly, you can provide a
much richer feedback as a manager if you are close to the work yourself.

If you came across this sort of advice below in the past, I recommend you
**don't follow** it:

> managers are usually not part of the teams that they manage. Teams are made
> up of peers, equals that function as equals. The manager is most often
> outside the team, giving occasional direction from above and clearing away
> administrative and procedural obstacles. By definition, the manager is not a
> peer and so can’t be part of the peer group. (Peopleware).

That is not to say that there aren't exceptions where the manager cannot be
part of the team. For example, a project may be so novel that no one except the
few reports deep in the weeds can actively contribute to the advancement of
that project.

This problem also seem to occur the higher up the management chain you go. It
must be difficult for the manager-of-managers to stay on top of each manager's
team work.

However, this does not mean that the manager shouldn't do their best to
understand the project as much as possible even if it is just to have support
when collateral damage happens.

It is hard to take an active interest in someone without getting to know them.
Making sure to invest in the relationship early the better as it takes time to
build trust.

## You Must Listen

"Listening is an active skill" they say, and in this case not only one of
"paying attention" but taking proactive effort to reflect on what has been
reported and to act on it.

A good way of creating space for listening is through recurring one-on-one
meetings. Those are the bare minimum to keep a relationship flowing, otherwise
without the space to exchange ideas, get feedback, or otherwise just rant,
there'll be a barrier between manager and report that might not serve either of
them.

It is easy to get caught on the "busyness-of-it" and put off 1:1's - both as a
report or as a manager. If this becomes a frequent occurrence it might be
because a potential problem is waiting in ambush.

Here is a small list of tips for active listening. It serves well just to be
aware of these things before you jump on a 1:1 with a report:

- Never interrupt. It frustrates your report and affects the full understanding
  of the message. If you have international people in your team, your way of
  communication might differ from theirs. Some cultures tend to provide [low
  context communication whereas others provide high
  context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures).
- Defer judgement. Remain open and neutral. If your report is telling you what
  problems they are going through, it is unhelpful to start expressing your
  personal opinions on the problem without being asked to or without taking
  into consideration social cues for when to do it.
- Avoid distractions. Please, just close Slack.

## You Must Reassure Through Real Recognition

> “People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a
> cooperative team.”

A pat on the back goes a long way, specially when it's done publicly. But
reassuring is not just about rewarding but building trust and cooperation.

Everyone likes to feel like they're winning, progressing, and that there's
validation for their good work. Many software development managers are
introverts who strugle with giving compliments. I think that more than a skill
that can be learned, you need to be constantly aware of opportunities to
provide recognitions (this is harder than it sounds).

In some places I worked for companies tended to have free-pizza events (or
insert another snack here) to celebrate team achievements. Where there's
nothing wrong with that and celebration is necessary for a team to function,
some organisations tend to over-characterise such acts as proof of their
generosity and reassurance that employees are doing a good job.

I think that most employees can see through this over characterisation and that
leaves them with a bitter taste in their mouths. Without proper reassurance and
**true** recognition, it doesn't matter how many pizza events there are, people
won't feel reassured and valued in their work. It might even be the opposite:
"why is the company going a long way with such events whereas people aren't
getting paid enough?". [panem et
circenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)

One of the best kinds of recognition is the financial one, specially when that
financial acknowledgement is made proactively from the manager side before
"official" raise ceremonies take place.

It might be harder to give financial recognition in start-up companies
struggling for cash. There are other means to account for that like granting
share options or title promotions. However, navigate the "title promotion"
situation with care. Although such promotions are a good way to recognise the
work that someone has done, eagerly promoting people who aren't ready for the
role as a retention strategy can backfire. This is **not** true recognition.

It is also incredible that in certain places salary raises only happen once a
year, and if you missed the date but got a lot of responsibility on your back,
you need to perform the role for a year without financial recognition.

It is very hard to be a manager in such companies as you don't have freedom to
*really* manage your team. Having been on that type of company before (but not
on the management side), it was very frustrating. I don't think I would ever
accept a management role on these types of places as I would be setting myself
up for failure.

Managing is hard, and there is so much material out there that isn't necessary
relevant or particularly useful to **your** situation.

From that, it is easy to grow cynical thinking that "no one can teach
management". But that is also not a helpful way to see things. I bet your
reports would raise their eyebrows if you said that to them.

Material on how to manage **creative workers** like software developers seems
particularly scarce, and creative-types seem to require a very different kind
of management than the general "KPI-based" literature teaches.

To make matters harder, there is usually not many clear productive metrics you
can track on how much impact a creative has made (usually in terms of revenue)
to the business. Of course you should be able to tell whether someone is
performing to the level of their role, but overall impact is a harder thing to
measure.

For example, you might have productive developers that look good on paper but
aren't exactly generating tons of value and are at the same time demanding a
lot of resources from the team. In the same way, you might have workers that
seem slower but always provide high-quality and impactful changes that are
aligned with core-business values.

These situations are tricky. Part of growing as a manager is recognising those
types of workers exist and providing feedback that enables them both to grow.

Even though improving as a manager is a slow process and difficult in a
different way than improving-as-a-developer, progressive improvement is
possible.

Managing takes a different source of energy than coding. If you are not a real
people person you have to be prepared to spend more time and energy being a
manager. Quite frankly, it's already very hard to keep on top of these "5
musts", specially as the number of reports goes up.

The final advice here is to keep an open mind. Check the literature and try and
read some books on management. Observe how your team members interact with
each other and listen to what they have to say. Read other posts like this one
about what other managers are thinking and think critically about what you
read. Don't take our word for it!

Some recommendations for reading:

- The Culture Map (Erin Meyer)
- Peopleware (Tom DeMarco)
- Ruined by Design (Mike Monteiro)
- The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier)

## Closing Remarks

Even after writing about all of these topics I myself am not able to perform
these advices to the dot every single day.

If not by an act of human fallibility, in some situations it is just not
possible to follow general advice, and I think this is OK.

What matters the most is (i) constantly learning and being actively interested
in how to be better at management, (ii) checking whether you'd like someone to
manage you the way you manage your team, (iii) critically thinking about
management and leadership decisions, (iv) keeping track of progress!
