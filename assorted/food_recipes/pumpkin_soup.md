## Ingredients

- 1kg of pumpkin (butternut is a favourite!).
- 350g of kumara (or another type of sweet potato).
- 2 heaped tablespoons of peanut butter.
- 1 tablespoon of garlic.
- 3 tablespoons of sweet chilli.
- 1 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seeds.
- 1 heaped tablespoon of stock powder.
- 1 1/2 tablespoon of curry powder.
- 1/2 a can of coconut cream (100% coconut).
- 1 1/2 tablespoon of soy sauce.
- 2 tablespoons of cumin and coriander.
- [optional] 1/2 tablespoon of nutritional yeast.

## Prep

- Steam the pumpkin and kumara (or sweet potato). Put the kumara on top because
  it cooks faster.
- While it's steaming (it will take a while), mix the dry ingredients in a
  sauce pan until they get toasty.
- Add the peanut butter and the liquid ingredients to the sauce pan.
- Once the pumpkin and kumara are done put them in a blender together with the
  sauce and blend them until the mixture is uniform.
