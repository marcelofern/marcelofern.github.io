## Toyota Prius
### Pros
- Toyota! High reliability.
- 5 stars safety rating (UCSR)
- Good fuel economy
  4.2L / 100km (reported by trade me)
  5.5L / 100km (reported by users) [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1bie8o1/comment/ln542mn/)
- Good storage size inside.

### Cons
- Battery replacement can be costly.
  (2018) $4-5k (100,000km ~ 150,000km vehicle) [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1bie8o1/comment/kvjtiod/)
  (2024) $2k for a 3rd party, $3.5k for a Toyota one [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/nzev/comments/1bie8o1/comment/kvn5ihh/)
  (2025) $2.5k for a new one [source](https://hybridbatteries.co.nz/promotions/)
  Note: It usually comes with a 3 year or 200,000km warranty (whichever comes first).
- Rattling noise inside due to the cheap plastic parts in the panel.
  I've found other reports in the internet of owners complaining about this.

- Slower acceleration.
- The 2010-2013 models present problems in the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)
  system (needs to be cleaned every 150,000 miles).
- Not rated for towing, though some people adventure to do so without issues
  for a not-so-heavy load.

## Mazda Premacy

  also pretty good. Lots of storage under the seat.

- 5 stars safety rating (VSRR 2024).
- Taller ride.
- Longer axis, so more stable ride.

### Cons
