<h2 id="the-author">The Author</h2>
<p>There are many so called “technical” books being published nowadays.
Perhaps more than there should be. One of the best ways to start
filtering out books that are worth attention from the ones that aren’t,
is by looking into who the author is and what kind of experience is
offered to the reader. Without further due, let’s get to it.</p>
<p>From the book’s cover excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jules J.Berman holds two Bachelor of Science degrees from MIT
(Mathematics and Earth and Planetary Sciences), a PhD from Temple
University, and an MD from the university of Miami. (…) In 1998, he
transferred to the US National Institutes of Health as a medical officer
and as the program director for pathology informatics in the Cancer
Diagnosis Program at the National Cancer Institute (…)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This biography raised my concern. I thought either this book would
have a big focus on bio-medicine computing, or the publisher messed up
and copied the biography from a medicine book writer instead.</p>
<p>Nope. That was all correct.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-proceed-reading-this-book">Why did I proceed reading
this book?</h2>
<p>This book was selected as “essential reading” for a Master’s module I
was studying at the time called “Big Data, challenges and
opportunities”. I am not sure I would ever have found this book
otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-the-content">Analysis of the content</h2>
<p>The book is rather basic. Each chapter usually starts with some
introduction and theory for the main topics, then goes towards the
author writing about his personal experiences - also related to those
topics - and finishes by presenting a couple of case studies.</p>
<p>One thing that made me interested out of the gate was the fact that
those study cases were mostly presented through Python code. That only
made sense to me. I wanted to learn big data, and I wanted to use the
most used language in practice. Perfect combo.</p>
<p>But to my disappointment, the Python study cases were, again, rather
basic. These study cases were mostly short, and some times I struggled
to understand why they were being presented within a chapter that
somehow seemed disconnected from the study itself. Or maybe the study
was disconnected from the chapter? Who knows.</p>
<p>This leaves us with the theory and the author’s personal
experiences.</p>
<p>The rest of the content wasn’t much computer science related. Not
enough for me in any case. The author didn’t present much of the science
behind Big Data, but rather, focused on the subject from a management
and conceptual point of view. Excusing himself by repeatedly saying that
Big Data isn’t a well defined area, and therefore it is very hard to
provide much directed content. Those topics (management and concepts)
are really important, but without presenting a few state-of-the-art
ideas and implementations of Big Data architectures, along with the
paradigms that come from the later, the content is deficient and not
much distinct from a book in ordinary database systems.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-take-from-this-book">What did I take from this
book?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always spend time studying your application before you get your
hands dirty.</li>
<li>Work hard to normalise your database as an unormalised database is
not sustainable in any scenario.</li>
<li>Make sure your data is immutable. Always.</li>
<li>Big Data is a loose concept and you should be suspicious of any
gurus who claim to have figured it out.</li>
</ul>
