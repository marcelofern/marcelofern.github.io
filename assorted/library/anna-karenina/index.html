<h1>Review</h0>
<pre><code class="language-">
Created at: 2025-04-08
</code></pre><p>Absolutely brilliant! I should've read this Russian classic much earlier.</p>
<p>The book is long, about ~1,000 pages, but it has been a very satisfying read and it didn't feel like a chore at any point.</p>
<p>This is my first Tolstoy, I will certainly be reading more.</p>
<h2>Book Quotes</h0>
<blockquote>Serving for the third year as head of one of the Moscow offices, Stepan</blockquote>
<blockquote>Arkadyich had acquired the respect as well as the affection of his</blockquote>
<blockquote>colleagues, subordinates, superiors, and all who had dealings with him. The</blockquote>
<blockquote>main qualities that had earned him this universal respect in the service</blockquote>
<blockquote>were, first, an extreme indulgence towards people, based on his awareness of</blockquote>
<blockquote>his own shortcomings; second, a perfect liberalism, not the sort he read</blockquote>
<blockquote>about in the newspapers, but the sort he had in his blood, which made him</blockquote>
<blockquote>treat all people, whatever their rank or status, in a perfectly equal and</blockquote>
<blockquote>identical way; and, third – most important – a perfect indifference to the</blockquote>
<blockquote>business he was occupied with, owing to which he never got carried away and</blockquote>
<blockquote>never made mistakes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>though he was now thirty-two, he did not have any regular, defined activity</blockquote>
<blockquote>or position in society, whereas among his comrades one was already a colonel</blockquote>
<blockquote>and imperial aide-de-camp, one a professor, one the director of a bank and a</blockquote>
<blockquote>railway or the chief of an office like Oblonsky, while he (he knew very well</blockquote>
<blockquote>what he must seem like to others) was a landowner, occupied with breeding</blockquote>
<blockquote>cows, shooting snipe, and building things, that is, a giftless fellow who</blockquote>
<blockquote>amounted to nothing and was doing, in society’s view, the very thing that</blockquote>
<blockquote>good-for-nothing people do.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘I don’t suppose one can possibly excuse such a man, though he is your</blockquote>
<blockquote>brother,’ Alexei Alexandrovich said sternly. Anna smiled. She understood that</blockquote>
<blockquote>he had said it precisely to show that considerations of kinship could not</blockquote>
<blockquote>keep him from expressing his sincere opinion. She knew this feature in her</blockquote>
<blockquote>husband and liked it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now he experienced a feeling similar to what a man would feel who was calmly</blockquote>
<blockquote>walking across a bridge over an abyss and suddenly saw that the bridge had</blockquote>
<blockquote>been taken down and below him was the bottomless deep.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You find it mean that I count the trees in the forest, while you give away</blockquote>
<blockquote>thirty thousand to Ryabinin; but you’ll have rent coming in and I don’t know</blockquote>
<blockquote>what else, while I won’t, and so I value what I’ve inherited and worked for…</blockquote>
<blockquote>We’re the aristocrats, and not someone who can only exist on hand-outs from</blockquote>
<blockquote>the mighty of this world and can be bought for twenty kopecks.’</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘You should get your hair cut, it’s too heavy, especially on the bald spot.’</blockquote>
<blockquote>He’s not a man, he’s a machine, and a wicked machine when he gets angry,’ she</blockquote>
<blockquote>added, recalling Alexei Alexandrovich in all the details of his figure,</blockquote>
<blockquote>manner of speaking and character, holding him guilty for everything bad she</blockquote>
<blockquote>could find in him and forgiving him nothing, on account of the terrible fault</blockquote>
<blockquote>for which she stood guilty before him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Kitty fell silent, not because she had nothing to say, but because she did</blockquote>
<blockquote>not want to disclose her secret thoughts even to her father.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Konstantin Levin did not like talking or hearing about the beauty of nature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For him words took away the beauty of what he saw.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hard as Stepan Arkadyich tried to be a solicitous father and husband, he</blockquote>
<blockquote>never could remember that he had a wife and children. He had a bachelor’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>tastes, and they alone guided him.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Inside the coach an old lady dozed in the corner and a young girl, apparently</blockquote>
<blockquote>just awakened, sat by the window, holding the ribbons of her white bonnet</blockquote>
<blockquote>with both hands. Bright and thoughtful, all filled with a graceful and</blockquote>
<blockquote>complex inner life to which Levin was a stranger, she looked through him at</blockquote>
<blockquote>the glowing sunrise. At the very instant when this vision was about to</blockquote>
<blockquote>vanish, the truthful eyes looked at him. She recognized him, and astonished</blockquote>
<blockquote>joy lit up her face. He could not have been mistaken. There were no other</blockquote>
<blockquote>eyes in the world like those. There was no other being in the world capable</blockquote>
<blockquote>of concentrating for him all the light and meaning of life. It was she. It</blockquote>
<blockquote>was Kitty. He realized that she was driving to Yergushovo from the railway</blockquote>
<blockquote>station. And all that had troubled Levin during that sleepless night, all the</blockquote>
<blockquote>decisions he had taken, all of it suddenly vanished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Levin went on talking with the landowner, trying to prove to him that all the</blockquote>
<blockquote>difficulty came from our not knowing the properties and habits of our worker;</blockquote>
<blockquote>but the landowner, like all people who think originally and solitarily, was</blockquote>
<blockquote>slow to understand another man’s thought and especially partial to his own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>He</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another difficulty lay in the peasants’ invincible mistrust of any other</blockquote>
<blockquote>purpose on the landowner’s part than the desire to fleece them as much as</blockquote>
<blockquote>possible. They were firmly convinced that his true goal, whatever he might</blockquote>
<blockquote>tell them, would always lie in what he did not tell them. And they</blockquote>
<blockquote>themselves, when they spoke, said many things, but never said what their true</blockquote>
<blockquote>goal was.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In a moment he had kneaded this social dough so well that the drawing room</blockquote>
<blockquote>was in fine form and ringing with voices.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Levin had often noticed in arguments between the most intelligent people that</blockquote>
<blockquote>after enormous efforts, an enormous number of logical subtleties and words,</blockquote>
<blockquote>the arguers would finally come to the awareness that what they had spent so</blockquote>
<blockquote>long struggling to prove to each other had been known to them long, long</blockquote>
<blockquote>before, from the beginning of the argument, but that they loved different</blockquote>
<blockquote>things and therefore did not want to name what they loved, so as not to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>challenged. He had often felt that sometimes during an argument you would</blockquote>
<blockquote>understand what your opponent loves, and suddenly come to love the same thing</blockquote>
<blockquote>yourself, and agree all at once, and then all reasonings would fall away as</blockquote>
<blockquote>superfluous; and sometimes it was the other way round: you would finally say</blockquote>
<blockquote>what you yourself love, for the sake of which you are inventing your</blockquote>
<blockquote>reasonings, and if you happened to say it well and sincerely, the opponent</blockquote>
<blockquote>would suddenly agree and stop arguing. That was the very thing he wanted to</blockquote>
<blockquote>say.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Who hast brought into unity those who were sundered, and hast ordained for</blockquote>
<blockquote>them an indissoluble bond of love” – how profound these words are, and how</blockquote>
<blockquote>well they correspond to what one feels at this moment!’ thought Levin. ‘Does</blockquote>
<blockquote>she feel the same as I do?’</blockquote>
<blockquote>In fact, those who understood it, to Vronsky’s mind, ‘in the right way’, did</blockquote>
<blockquote>not understand it in any way, but behaved generally as well-bred people do</blockquote>
<blockquote>with regard to all the complicated and insoluble questions that surround life</blockquote>
<blockquote>on all sides – decently, avoiding hints and unpleasant questions. They</blockquote>
<blockquote>pretended to understand fully the significance and meaning of the situation,</blockquote>
<blockquote>to acknowledge and even approve of it, but considered it inappropriate and</blockquote>
<blockquote>unnecessary to explain it all.</blockquote>
<blockquote>painting. He knew it was impossible to forbid Vronsky to toy with painting;</blockquote>
<blockquote>he knew that he and all the dilettantes had every right to paint whatever</blockquote>
<blockquote>they liked, but he found it unpleasant. It was impossible to forbid a man to</blockquote>
<blockquote>make a big wax doll and kiss it. But if this man with the doll came and sat</blockquote>
<blockquote>in front of a man in love and began to caress his doll the way the man in</blockquote>
<blockquote>love caressed his beloved, the man in love would find it unpleasant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the first moment he felt like a man who, having suddenly received a</blockquote>
<blockquote>violent blow from behind, turns with vexation and a desire for revenge to</blockquote>
<blockquote>find out who did it, and realizes that he has accidentally struck himself,</blockquote>
<blockquote>that there is no one to be angry with and he must endure and ease the pain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>all this tension, while producing no results, gave Levin a painful feeling</blockquote>
<blockquote>similar to that vexing impotence one experiences in dreams when one tries to</blockquote>
<blockquote>use physical force.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘Lord, have mercy, forgive us, help us!’ he repeated words that somehow</blockquote>
<blockquote>suddenly came to his lips. And he, an unbeliever, repeated these words not</blockquote>
<blockquote>just with his lips. Now, in that moment, he knew that neither all his doubts,</blockquote>
<blockquote>nor the impossibility he knew in himself of believing by means of reason,</blockquote>
<blockquote>hindered him in the least from addressing God. It all blew off his soul like</blockquote>
<blockquote>dust. To whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself,</blockquote>
<blockquote>his soul and his love to be?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Levin remembered being sent somewhere. Once he was sent to move a table and a</blockquote>
<blockquote>sofa. He did it zealously, thinking it was for her (his pregnant wife), and</blockquote>
<blockquote>only later learned that he had prepared his own bed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What he felt for this small being was not at all what he had expected. There</blockquote>
<blockquote>was nothing happy or joyful in this feeling; on the contrary, there was a new</blockquote>
<blockquote>tormenting fear. There was an awareness of a new region of vulnerability. And</blockquote>
<blockquote>this awareness was so tormenting at first, the fear lest this helpless being</blockquote>
<blockquote>should suffer was so strong, that because of it he scarcely noticed the</blockquote>
<blockquote>strange feeling of senseless joy and even pride he had experienced when the</blockquote>
<blockquote>baby sneezed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘In infinite time, in the infinity of matter, in infinite space, a</blockquote>
<blockquote>bubble-organism separates itself, and that bubble holds out for a while and</blockquote>
<blockquote>then bursts, and that bubble is – me.’</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reasoning led him into doubt and kept him from seeing what he should and</blockquote>
<blockquote>should not do. Yet when he did not think, but lived, he constantly felt in</blockquote>
<blockquote>his soul the presence of an infallible judge who decided which of two</blockquote>
<blockquote>possible actions was better and which was worse; and whenever he did not act</blockquote>
<blockquote>as he should, he felt it at once.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Understanding clearly then for the first time that for every man and for</blockquote>
<blockquote>himself nothing lay ahead but suffering, death and eternal oblivion, he</blockquote>
<blockquote>decided that it was impossible to live that way, that he had either to</blockquote>
<blockquote>explain his life so that it did not look like the wicked mockery of some</blockquote>
<blockquote>devil, or shoot himself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘And don’t all philosophical theories do the same thing, leading man by a way</blockquote>
<blockquote>of thought that is strange and unnatural to him to the knowledge of what he</blockquote>
<blockquote>has long known and known so certainly that without it he would not even be</blockquote>
<blockquote>able to live? Is it not seen clearly in the development of each philosopher’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>theory that he knows beforehand, as unquestionably as the muzhik Fyodor and</blockquote>
<blockquote>no whit more clearly than he, the chief meaning of life, and only wants to</blockquote>
<blockquote>return by a dubious mental path to what everybody knows?</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘It’s the newspapers that all say the same thing,’ said the prince. ‘That’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>true. And it’s so much the same that it’s like frogs before a thunderstorm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can’t hear anything on account of them.’</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘I’ll get angry in the same way with the coachman Ivan, argue in the same</blockquote>
<blockquote>way, speak my mind inappropriately, there will be the same wall between my</blockquote>
<blockquote>soul’s holy of holies and other people, even my wife, I’ll accuse her in the</blockquote>
<blockquote>same way of my own fear and then regret it, I’ll fail in the same way to</blockquote>
<blockquote>understand with my reason why I pray, and yet I will pray – but my life now,</blockquote>
<blockquote>my whole life, regardless of all that may happen to me, every minute of it,</blockquote>
<blockquote>is not only not meaningless, as it was before, but has the unquestionable</blockquote>
<blockquote>meaning of the good which it is in my power to put into it!’</blockquote>
