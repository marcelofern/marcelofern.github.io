# Thoughts On 3 Years of Management

```

I have been managing people for the past 3 years at my current job. This is
not extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager at best.

As I reflect on my journey so far, the idea is to talk through some lessons I
learnt from managing other developers and on reoccurring patterns I have
observed.

Now, a post about management is not cringe enough unless there is a "top list"
of advice for other managers that summarises my current thinking. The one I
could come up with is composed of 5 **must's**.

1. You must facilitate.
2. You must take an active interest in the development of your reports.
3. You must reassure through real recognition.
4. You must listen.
5. You must keep an open mind about your own management skills.

Note: Having innate charisma would be of great help as it would make it easier
to perform some of these points. However, the typical nerd type is not usually
charismatic. We need to work harder on it. More on that later.

## You Must Facilitate

Being promoted to manager performing well as a developer is a regular
occurrence in many companies. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to not be good at managing their peers.

Promoting a good developer does ensure that the new manager won't be a mere
conduit for communication. Having experience in the field will help them
facilitate (at least) the technical discussions.

However, The Venn diagram intersection between skills required to be a good
developer and to be a good manager is a narrow one. Facilitation skills don't
seem to regularly feature on the good-developer skill set.

My first challenge stepping into the role was to manage my own conflicts of
interest and lack of guidance and experience on how to manage other developers.

I wanted to continue developing my coding skills as I deemed my
individual-contributor skills more important than management and leadership.

That meant that I wasn't facilitating much. The lack of leadership and
direction quickly hampered the development of one of my teams.

Once that team grew to about ~7 developers the situation became unsustainable.

I wasn't having enough quality time to spend on important coding tasks because
I was constantly spending time on management duties. At the same time I wasn't
helping to unblock my team's work as well as I could, since I spent too much
time coding.

I had to step back and rethink my approach to balance facilitation with my
coding responsibilities. Being **proactive** about facilitating helped me save
time for myself and to relieve stress from my team. It may sound cliché, but it
is true that finding the problems before they happen and answering the
questions before they are asked are important to help reduce the stress level
across your team.

However, the most important thing was coming to the realisation that unblocking
7 people and letting them do good work was much more important than me, as a
single contributor, being able to write some code. This didn't make my work
easier though, there are many ways to facilitate progress, and some ways are
harder than others.

The easiest kinds of facilitation are the ones defined as a technical problem
posed by the product being developed. For example, the product manager asks for
a feature but the details aren't clear enough for a developer to jump on the
task. You pop a meeting with the product manager and the client, and together
you clear up requirements so that a developer is not stuck in a place they
don't want to be with vague requirements and lack of direction.

The goal in these situations isn't to trace the design for the solution (the
developer will do that), but to make sure requirements are understood and that
there is a definition of what "done" means in the context of that task.

These facilitations aren't hard. They only take time and organising.
I.e., getting the relevant people together in a meeting, and taking the time to
properly write up details of what has been discussed and agreed.

The hardest kinds of facilitation happen when a team member is having a hard
time either because of external factors or conflicts between colleagues. This
is the real human-factor part of the job. I have little experience on this.

These situations seem to take a lot of time and energy to resolve. Each
situation of this type is different and facilitation might have to be defined
case by case. The tools available by the business will be relevant here and
the manager needs to be aware of them to put them to good use. E.g.,
unlimited leave, team rotation, mental-health days, external mediation, etc.

My only general observation is to treat the situation with compassion and
empathy. In the end of the day a manager will be dealing with people-problems
frequently. In the eyes of the person being troubled, their problems are going
to be concerning than what they may be comfortable telling you. You are at the
risk of miss-characterising the problem if you don't handle it well. There is
no point on trying to play a hard hand by being the authoritarian boss that
dictates solutions or does not take the time to care and understand "it's your
job, just do it!". This almost always goes wrong and makes the manager lose the
respect of their team.

## You Must Take An Active Interest In The Development Of Your Reports

Of all the "musts", this is the one that took me the longest to think and write
about. It's hard to find a recipe for what "taking an active interest" is, even
though most people have a good intuition about what this phrase means.

Different people need different things depending on where they are at their
careers, what they want to achieve, and who they are.

The first step is understanding what each report needs based on their career
stage, goals, and personality. But there is a meta step here too. Both you and
the report need to be willing to learn and improve together for that
relationship to work and those questions to be answered. It's not just about
the report's growth but also the manager's willingness to evolve in response to
their team's needs

In the best manager-managed relationships I've had **both** people were
learning together what they needed from and what they could provide to each
other. I didn't understand for a very long time that this dynamic was what
nurtured the environment for a great relationship.

To use an analogy from pedagogy theory:

> Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher
> cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with
> students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but
> one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while
> being taught also teach. They be-come jointly responsible for a process in
> which all grow − Paulo Freire.

Having a manager that allows themselves to not know but are comfortable asking
dumb questions is a **great thing**. I have had managers on the other side of
the spectrum who pretended to be acquainted with things they had no clue about
because they were insecure of showing a potential shortcoming to their reports.
This is a **bad thing**.

It is difficult to provide quality help to develop a report's career if the
manager is not an **active** member of the team. It is hard to relate to
the work of a report if you have no skin in the game.

This is why I am in favour of managers that get their hands dirty on the
factory line at least some of the time. This helps building team spirit and
camaraderie. Frankly, you can provide a much richer feedback as a manager if
you are close to the work yourself.

If you came across this sort of advice below in the past, I recommend you
**don't follow** it:

> managers are usually not part of the teams that they manage. Teams are made
> up of peers, equals that function as equals. The manager is most often
> outside the team, giving occasional direction from above and clearing away
> administrative and procedural obstacles. By definition, the manager is not a
> peer and so can’t be part of the peer group. (Peopleware).

Of course there are exceptions where the manager cannot be part of the team.
For example, a project may be so novel that no one except the few reports deep
in the weeds can actively contribute to the advancement of that project.

However, this does not mean that the manager shouldn't do their best to
understand the project as much as possible even if it is just to have support
when collateral damage happens.

It is hard to take an active interest in someone without getting to know them.
So make sure to invest on that relationship and situate yourself within the
company so that you can provide active support for your team. The earlier the
better. It takes time to build trust.

## You Must Listen

"Listening is an active skill" they say, and in this case not only one of
"paying attention" but taking proactive effort to reflect on what has been
reported and to act on it.

A good way of creating space for listening is through recurring one-on-one
meetings. Those are the bare minimum to keep a relationship flowing, otherwise
without the space to exchange ideas, get feedback, or otherwise just rant,
there'll be a barrier between manager and report that might not serve either of
them.

It is easy to get caught on the "busyness-of-it" and put off 1:1's - both as a
report or as a manager. If this becomes a frequent occurrence it might be
because a potential problem is waiting in ambush.

Here is a small list of tips for active listening. It serves well just to be
aware of these things before you jump on a 1:1 with a report:

- Never interrupt. It frustrates your report and affects the full understanding
  of the message. If you have international people in your team, your way of
  communication might differ from theirs. Some cultures tend to provide [low
  context communication whereas others provide high
  context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures).
- Defer judgement. Remain open and neutral. If your report is telling you what
  problems they are going through, it is unhelpful to start expressing your
  personal opinions on the problem without being asked to or without taking
  into consideration social cues for when to do it.
- Avoid distractions. Please, just close Slack.

## You Must Reassure Through Real Recognition

> “People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a
> cooperative team.”

A pat on the back goes a long way, specially when it's done publicly. But
reassuring is not just about rewarding but building trust and cooperation.

Everyone likes to feel like they're winning, progressing, and that there's
validation for their good work. Many software development managers are
introverts and giving compliments is hard. I think that more than a skill that
can be learned, you need to be constantly aware of opportunities to provide
recognitions (this is harder than it sounds).

In some places I worked companies tended to have free-pizza events (or insert
another snack here) to celebrate team achievements. Where there's nothing wrong
with that and celebration is necessary for a team to function, some
organisations tend to over-characterise such acts as proof of their generosity
and reassurance that employees are doing a good job.

I think that most employees can see through this over characterisation and that
leaves them with a bitter taste in their mouths. Without proper reassurance and
true recognition, it doesn't matter how many pizza events there are, people
won't feel reassured and valued in their work. It might even be the opposite:
"why is the company going a long way with such events whereas people aren't
getting paid enough?". [panem et
circenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)

One of the best kinds of recognition is the financial one, specially when that
financial offer is made proactively from the manager's side before "official"
raise ceremonies take place.

It is incredible that in certain places salary raises only happen once a year,
and if you missed the date but got a lot of responsibility on your back, you
need to perform the role for a year without financial recognition. It is very
hard to be a manager in such companies as you don't have freedom to *really*
manage your team.

## You must keep an open mind about your management skills.

Managing is hard, and there is so much material out there that isn't necessary
relevant or particularly useful to **your** situation.

From that, it is easy to grow cynical that "no one can teach management", but
that is also not a helpful way of seeing things. I bet your reports would raise
their eyebrows if you said that to them.

Material on how to manage **creative workers** like software developers seems
particularly scarce, and creatives seem to require a very different kind of
management than the general "KPI-based" literature often teaches.

To make matters harder, there is usually not many clear productive metrics you
can track on how much impact a creative has made (usually in terms of revenue)
to the business. Of course you should be able to tell whether someone is
performing to the level of their role, but overall impact is a harder thing to
measure.

All that said, I **do** think that improving is possible, but it is a different
art than improving technical skills.

Managing also takes a different source of energy than coding. If you are not a
real people person you have to be prepared to spend more time and energy being
a manager. This can be frustrating at times.

The final advice here is to keep an open mind. Check the literature and try and
read some books on management. Read other posts like this one about what other
managers are thinking and think critically about what you read.

Some recommendations for reading:

- The Culture Map (Erin Meyer)
- Peopleware (Tom DeMarco)
- Ruined by Design (Mike Monteiro)


## Closing Remarks

Even after writing about all of these topics I myself am not able to perform
these advices every single day.

If not by an act of human fallibility, in some situations it is just not
possible to follow general advice, and I think this is OK.

What matters the most is (i) constantly learning and being actively interested
in how to be better at management, (ii) checking whether you'd like someone to
manage you the way you manage your team, (iii) critically think about
management and leadership decisions, (iv) keep track of progress!
