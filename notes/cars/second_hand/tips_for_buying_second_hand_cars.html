<h1>Tips for Buying Second Hand Cars</h1>
<h2>Bonnet</h2>
<p>Ideally you want to buy a car that has done its kms on the highway instead of
in the city. This is because the constant breaking and accelerating from city
driving can damage the car.</p>
<p>To verify that a car has done its kms on the highway you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the front bonnet for small scratches of paint. That indicates that
some debris from the road and impact with insects has caused some damage on
the paint.</li>
<li>Do the same as above for the headlights.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can't see any, ask if the car has ever been painted - it could indicate
previous accidents. You should walk away if that's the case.</p>
<h2>Brake pedal</h2>
<p>Check for wear and tear on the brake pedal. It could indicate that the vehicle
has been through many stop-and-go situations. If it is too worn, walk away.</p>
<h2>Seat belt</h2>
<p>Similarly to the brake pedal, wear and tear on the seat belt can indicate many
stop-and-go situations.</p>
<h2>Oil Changes</h2>
<p>Regular oil changes must have been done every 8,000 km.</p>
<h2>Odometer</h2>
<p>The &quot;sweet spot&quot; (depreciation vs cost of repair) of a car is usually within
the range of ~40,000 km and ~150,000 km.</p>
<h2>Side panels</h2>
<p>From the front of the car, look down the side panels for any sign of uniformity
on the texture or paint.</p>
<p>See where the door components connect to the side of the car for any sign of
extra spray paint.</p>
<p>Run your finger on the edge of the bonnet onto the door of the side panels to
feel any change of texture that could indicate a paint job.</p>

<h2>Fender Flare bolt</h2>
<p>Check if the fender flare bolt is a bit wasted, this means that some serious
repair has taken place:</p>

<h2>Wheels</h2>
<p>Check that the tear on the front wheels are uniform, and do the same for the
back wheels. That may indicate some alignment problem.</p>
<p>Tyres age and become harder, leading to cracks. Look for age stamps (e.g.,
'2319' for the 23rd week of 2019) and consider replacing tires older than 3-4
years</p>
<h2>NZ specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask if the dealer can do WoF and Rego on the same day.</li>
<li>Ask for a AA pre-purchase inspection:

</ul>
