# Under The Dome Review

The novel is set in a small city in Maine that gets enveloped by an invisible
and indestructible dome laid out by an alien group of kids.

The plot revolves around the characters in the city trying to survive the harsh
conditions in the dome. Namely, the raising pollution levels, the lack of
medical staff, and the evil second selectman Jim Rennie who's trying to take
full control of the city; driven by an ego trip.

The characters are unrealistic to a point where they always seem to take the
dumbest available action. Colonel Barbara (the good-guy protagonist), for
example, has an official letter from the president of the United States
allowing him to establish marshal law inside the dome, but instead, he refuses
to do so many times, angrily claiming that "The government and the army
(Cox)" don't understand what is happening inside the dome. But also Barbara
doesn't attempt to give any explanation to them whatsoever, throwing his hands
and saying that the situation "is too complex you wouldn't understand", even
though there is nothing new about a small city influenced by a corrupt
politician. Julia Shumway also doesn't do much in the way of helping and
completely ignores Cox, same about the Duke's wife, who could've mailed the
files to anyone outside the dome. None of the civilians under the dome are
interested in helping Barbara even after knowing about the authority granted to
him. Ultimately none of the authorities (Jim, Randalph, etc.) are worried about
what would eventually happen to them and their mischiefs under the dome if the
dome ever disappeared - they are so careless and thus not believable.

These, and many other scenes, make the characters very hard to buy as thinking
agents of their own.

The end of the plot is a classic deus-ex-machina where minutes before their
likely death, the main characters find out a way to get the dome lifted by
begging the aliens to lift it away, which one alien girl gladly accepts.. It is
pretty bizarre and it all happens in about 10 pages - making the end a cheap
cope out of what had been an interesting concept to write about.
