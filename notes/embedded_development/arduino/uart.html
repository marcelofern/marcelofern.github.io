<h1>Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)</h1>
<p>This is the protocol that arduino boards use to communicate back with the computer via <code>Serial.print()</code>.</p>
<p>The basic properties of this protocol are:</p>
<ol><li>It's asynchronous (doesn't rely on a clock signal).</li><li>The speed is configurable.</li><li>The format is configurable.</li></ol>
<p>In many cases UART has been replaced by either I2C or SPI, but it is nonetheless still used for low-speed low-throughput projects because it is very simple and low-cost to implement given that it requires less wires/ports. More on that later.</p>
<h2>Serial</h2>
<p>The serial class allows you to send or receive data from the computer to the arduino, or to another device connected to the arduino via TX and RX pins.</p>
<p>The difference is that:</p>
<ol><li>When sending data via USB, use the <code>Serial</code> class.</li><li>When sending data via TX/RX pins, use the <code>Serial1</code> class.</li><li>Some other boards also have <code>Serial2</code> and <code>Serial3</code>.</li></ol>
<p>The UART interface available via <code>Serial</code> has the following methods:</p>
<ul><li><code>Serial.begin()</code> begins serial communication, with a specified baud rate. You can pick either 9600 or 115200. This function is usually called during the<code>setup()</code> function on arduino sketches.</li><li><code>Serial.print()</code> prints the UART data in the Serial Monitor.</li><li><code>Serial.printl()</code> is the same as .print() but adds a new line at the end.</li><li><code>Serial.available()</code> checks if serial data is available when sending commands from the Serial Monitor.</li><li><code>Serial.read()</code> reads data from the serial port.</li><li><code>Serial.write()</code> writes data to the serial port.</li></ul>
<h2>UART basics</h2>
<p>UART serially sends one bit at a time. The series of bits has a starting bit, followed by several data bits, an optional parity bit, and one or more stopping bits.</p>
<p>Given that UART communication doesn't rely on a clock signal, it relies on a pre-determined baud rate to figure when to send/read a bit.</p>
<p><img alt="parallel vs sync" src="serial_vs_parallel_comms.png"></p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231208204935/https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/uart">source</a></p>
<p>The advantage here is that synchronous communication only requires one wire, so this can make your circuit cheaper and easier to manufacture.</p>
<p>Also consider that the transmitter and the receiver must have the same common ground to be able to interpret LOW/HIGH signals with the right reference.</p>
<blockquote>The key components of UART include the transmitter, receiver, and baud rate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The transmitter collects data from a source, formats it into serial bits, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>sends it via a TX (Transmit) pin. The receiver receives it via a RX (Receive)</blockquote>
<blockquote>pin, processes incoming serial data and converts it into parallel data for</blockquote>
<blockquote>the host system. The baud rate determines the speed of data transmission.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231208204935/https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/communication/uart">source</a></p>
<h2>Baud rates</h2>
<p>Important things to know about baud rates:</p>
<ul><li>Measured in bits per second.</li><li>Both receivers and transmitters must agree on the value, otherwise communication is out of sync and won't make sense.</li><li>The higher the baud rate, more precision is required to synchronise receiver and transmitter. There are higher risks involved.</li></ul>
<p>A way to circumvent the problem from the last point is via UART Flow Control</p>
<h2>UART Flow Control</h2>
<blockquote>UART Flow Control is a method for slow and fast devices to communicate with</blockquote>
<blockquote>each other over UART without the risk of losing data. Consider the case where</blockquote>
<blockquote>two units are communicating over UART. A transmitter T is sending a long</blockquote>
<blockquote>stream of bytes to a receiver R. R is a slower device than T, and R cannot</blockquote>
<blockquote>keep up. It needs to either do some processing on the data or empty some</blockquote>
<blockquote>buffers before it can keep receiving data.</blockquote>
<blockquote>R needs to tell T to stop transmitting for a while. This is where flow</blockquote>
<blockquote>control comes in. Flow control provides extra signaling to inform the</blockquote>
<blockquote>transmitter that it should stop (pause) or start (resume) the transmission.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Several forms of flow control exist. For example, hardware flow control uses</blockquote>
<blockquote>extra wires, where the logic level on these wires define whether the</blockquote>
<blockquote>transmitter should keep sending data or stop. With software flow control,</blockquote>
<blockquote>special characters are sent over the normal data lines to start or stop the</blockquote>
<blockquote>transmission.</blockquote>

<h2>Message format</h2>
<p><img alt="uart_message_format" src="uart_message_format.png"></p>
<p>The message starts with a <b>start bit</b>, which is always LOW. The receiver starts to prepare itself for receiving a message.</p>
<p>Followed by that, the message includes the <b>data bits</b>. Those bits can vary in number, and this number needs to be agreed upon by both the receiver and the transmitter. A common length is 8 bits (1 byte), but this can vary based on the application. This length is also referred to as _character size_.</p>
<p>The <b>parity</b> bit is an error-checking mechanism to detect transmission errors. A common use is to set the parity bit as 1 if the number of "1" bits in the data message is odd, and 0 if it is even.</p>
<p>The <b>stop</b> bit marks the end of the message. The polarity may vary depending on the system, and some times two stop bits may be applied.</p>
<h2>Sending a message to arduino from the monitor</h2>
<p>You can pop a monitor open and write characters and press enter to send them to the arduino with the script below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include <Arduino.h>

char incomingByte = 0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);

    incomingByte = Serial.read();
    Serial.print("received: ");
    // Print byte in decimal.
    if (incomingByte == '\n') {
      Serial.println("\\n");
    } else {
      Serial.println(incomingByte);
    }

    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  }
}
