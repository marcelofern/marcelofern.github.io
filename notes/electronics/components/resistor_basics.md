## Laws

- Ohm's law: `R = V/I`

## In Series

R(series) = R1 + R2

## In Parallel

R(parallel) = (R1*R2) / (R1+R2)

Tip: By parallelising resistors you **always get a smaller resistance**.

## Power (dissipated)

```
P = IV
P = I²R
P = V²/R
```

## Intuition

- A large resistor in series with a small resistor has roughly the resistance
  of the larger one.
- Inversely, a large resistor in parallel with a small resistor has roughly the
  resistance of the smaller one.
- To reduce the resistance, connect a (much) larger resistor in parallel.
- Putting N resistors of value X in parallel is the same as having a resistor
  of value X/N

## Trivia

- Usually made of some conducting stuff (carbon, thin metal, carbon film, wire
  of poor conductivity...) and characterised by its resistance.
- Most frequent resistors come in values from 1Ω to 10MΩ.
- Also characterised by how much power they can *safely* dissipate. Usually
  around 1/4W or 1/8W
