## Laws

- Ohm's law: `R = V/I`

## In Series

R(series) = R1 + R2

## In Parallel

R(parallel) = (R1*R2) / (R1+R2)

Tip: By parallelising resistors you **always get a smaller resistance**.

## Trivia

- Usually made of some conducting stuff (carbon, thin metal, carbon film, wire of
poor conductivity...) and characterised by its resistance:

- Most frequent resistors come in values from 1Ω to 10MΩ.

- Also characterised by how much power they can *safely* dissipate. Usually
  around 1/4W or 1/8W
