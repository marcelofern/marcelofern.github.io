# Exercise 1.4

## Pre-exercise theory

Compound expressions represent the application of an operator to one or more
operands.

For example (* 5 2) is a compound-expression as the operator (+) operates on
the operands 5 and 2.

Compound expressions are used all the time in LISP. One example of non-compound
expression is the evaluation of a literal number like typing `421` and hitting
enter in a REPL.

## The question

> Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators
> are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behaviour of
> the following procedure:

```scm
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
        ((if (> b 0) + -)) a b
)
```

The `if` statement checks if `b` is greater 0, if so, it returns +, otherwise
it returns -. This indicates which operation is going to be taken on the
operands `a b`.

In LISP, the operators `+` and `-` are procedures themselves:

```scm
scheme@(guile-user) [9]> +
$59 = #<procedure + (#:optional _ _ . _)>
scheme@(guile-user) [9]> -
$60 = #<procedure - (#:optional _ _ . _)>
```

So they can be selected using conditional statements.
