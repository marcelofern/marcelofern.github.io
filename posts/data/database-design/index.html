<h1 class="title">Database Design</h1>
<p class="author">Marcelo Fernandes</p>
<p class="date">September 2, 2020</p>
</header>
<h2 id="data-model">Data Model</h2>
<p>A database design usually starts by the high-level description of the
schema. The idea is to analyse the organisation requirements and frame
it on a schema that a variety of users would understand.</p>
<p>The outcome of this exercise, is a data model. A data model is a
representation (often in a diagram) of the data relationship in an
organisation. This representation will describe the data and provide a
guideline of how this data could be manipulated and retrieved.</p>
<p>The data model is composed of three components</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural: A collection of relationships that construct the data.
This includes the diagrams, the entities and their dependencies, what
their names are, what types of data those entities host, etc.</li>
<li>Manipulative: The available operations on the data. Directives to
instruct what data can be retrieved, updated, or deleted.</li>
<li>Integrity constraints: Checks that guarantee data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The optimal data model can be found if the following criteria is
satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent: The model represents a clear mapping of the organisation
information.</li>
<li>Minimal: No entity or property is dispensable. No non-necessary
dependencies are present. It is also easy for all the organisation users
to understand the data model.</li>
<li>Distinguishable: Different data can be told apart without
confusion.</li>
<li>Non-redundant: There is only one way to represent an entity and its
attributes.</li>
<li>Not application bound: The data model should not change based on
what database system is being used.</li>
<li>Extensible: New features can be added without breaking the existent
schema.</li>
<li>Easy to draw: If the diagram of a said data-model is difficult to
draw, one of the criteria above hasn’t been completely satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entity-relationship-er">Entity-Relationship (ER)</h2>
<p>An entity is an object in the organisation that can be represented in
the database (a person, location, thing, concept, event, etc…). An
entity can have any number of attributes. Those attributes are
properties that describe the data stored in that entity. An entity that
represents a location, could have a set of coordinates as one of its
attributes. Entities are then connected via relationships.</p>
<h2 id="database-design-phases">Database Design Phases</h2>
<p>The process of designing a database can be split into three different
phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual Phase: The creation of a data model concept that is put
to proof against users’ requirements. This phase does not involve any
particular implementation details. This phase will present the entities
and their attributes.</li>
<li>Logical Phase: The model concept is enhanced with the relationship
logic. This means that the relationship between data, its constrains,
and data retrieval/update/deletion queries are added. The model should
then be put to proof against users’ requirements once more.</li>
<li>Physical Phase: Decision of how the database is implemented. It
takes into account which database management system (DBMS) will be used,
what tables will be created, what security protocol will be implemented,
what constraints and indexes will be created, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the database design is an organic process. The database
will change as the organisation grows and requires updates.</p>
<h2 id="functional-dependency">Functional Dependency</h2>
<p>A functional dependency between attributes describes how those
attributes are related.</p>
<p><strong>Formal definition</strong>: If A and B are attributes of a
relation R, B is functionally dependent on A if each value of A is
associated with exactly one value of B. In this case, A is called the
determinant Notation: <code>A ® B</code> (or <code>A -&gt; B</code>)</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider an entity Player with the
following attributes: <em>playerId, fName, position</em>. We can
determine the position of a certain player, by knowing what the value of
playerId is. In other words, playerId determines the position
(<code>playerId -&gt; position</code>). But the opposite is not true,
knowing the position doesn’t imply knowing the playerId.</p>
<p>Functional dependencies can be broken down into 3 different
types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Partial Functional Dependency: A -&gt; B is a partial functional
dependency if there is an attribute that can be removed from A and yet
the dependency still holds. Consider the entity Player with the
attributes playerId, name, and teamId. We have that:</p>
<pre><code>playerId, name -&gt; teamId</code></pre>
<p>But the name attribute is not really necessary to determine teamId.
Therefore, the name attribute could be removed but the functional
dependency would still exist between playerId and teamId.</p></li>
<li><p>Full Functional Dependency: A -&gt; B is a full functional
dependency if removal of any attribute from A results in the dependency
no longer existing. Consider the entity Player with attributes playerId
and position. We then have that:</p>
<pre><code>playerId -&gt; position</code></pre>
<p>If we remove the playerId attribute, the dependency no longer
exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Transitive Dependency: Given that A, B, and C are attributes of a
relation and A -&gt; B and B -&gt; C, then C is a transivite dependency
of A via B. Consider the entity Player:</p>
<pre><code>playerId -&gt; name, position, teamId, teamName
teamId -&gt; teamName</code></pre>
<p>playerId determines the teamName attribute via the teamId attribute.
In this case, teamName is transitively dependent on playerId via
teamId.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="normalisation">Normalisation</h2>
<p>Normalisation is one of the most important aspects of database
design. It is common to find databases that have more entities than
necessary. The same redundancy often happens to entities’ attributes as
well. The normalisation technique aims to minimise those redundancies by
finding the minimal set of entities and attributes required to meet
users’ requirements.</p>
<p>A normalised database is easier to manipulate and to understand.
Normalisation provides easy access to the database, prevents maintenance
overheads, and enhances user experience in general. Additionally, new
users will have a more compact learning curve when being introduced to
the database for the first time.</p>
<p>Normalisation rules can be broken down into the following normal
forms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First Normal Form</li>
<li>Second Normal Form</li>
<li>Third Normal Form</li>
<li>Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
<li>Fourth Normal Form</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form (1NF)</h2>
<p>For a table to be in the 1NF, it must conform to the following 4
rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Single Valued Attributes: Each column in a table should not contain
multiple values. As a hypothetical example, on a table defining a
Location entity, an entry in the column “country” cannot be “New Zealand
&amp; Brazil”.</li>
<li>Attribute Domain does not change: In each column, the values stored
must be of the same type. On a table defining a Location entity, an
entry in the column “country” cannot be a number, while the other
entries are a text.</li>
<li>Unique name for Attributes/Columns: No repetition of columns names
within the same entity. The entity “Country” cannot have two columns
called “population”.</li>
<li>Order doesn’t matter: The order that the data is stored in the table
does not affect any database operation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form (2NF)</h2>
<p>A table is in the 2NF if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is in the First Normal Form (1NF)</li>
<li>Has Partial Dependency: An attribute in a table depends on a part of
the primary key, but not on the whole key. As an example, if we have an
entity “Student Score” which has the attributes: “student_id”,
“subject_id”, “score”, and “teacher_name”. The attribute “teacher_name”
only depends on the “subject_id”, and the primary key of this table is
the combination of “student_id + subject_id”. Note that to remove this
dependency we only need to move the “teacher_name” property to the
“Subject” entity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative Definition: A table is in the first normal form and every
non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary
key.</p>
<p>Note: A table with transitive dependencies can be in the 2NF.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form (3NF)</h2>
<p>A table is in the 3NF if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is in the Second Normal Form (2NF)</li>
<li>Does not have Transitive Dependency (TD): The TD happens when a
non-prime attribute has a dependency on another non-prime attribute. If
a “Score” entity has the properties: “score_id”, “student_id”,
“subject_id”, “marks”, “exam_name”, “total_marks”. The prime keys are
“student_id” and “subject_id”. But the “total_marks” depends on the
“exam_name”, that does not belong to the prime keys set. In this case,
the solution is to create a new “Exam” entity with the attributes:
“exam_name” and “total_marks”</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative Definition: A table is in the first and second normal
form and no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the
primary-key.</p>
<h2 id="boyce-and-codd-normal-form-bcnf">Boyce and Codd Normal Form
(BCNF)</h2>
<p>A table is in the BCNF if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is in the Third Normal Form (3NF)</li>
<li>For each functional dependency (X -&gt; Y), X should be a super key.
If we have an entity “Students Subjects” with the attributes:
“student_id”, “subject”, and “professor”, we have “student_id” and
“subject” as the primary keys. Given that a subject can have multiple
professors, there is a dependency between professor -&gt; subject. So we
have an attribute depending on a prime/super key. To solve this problem,
the solution is to create a “Professor” entity with the columns
“professor_id”, “professor_name”, and “subject”.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="fourth-normal-form-4nf">Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</h2>
<p>A table is in the BCNF if:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is in the Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
<li>There is no Multi-Valued Dependency Given that A -&gt; B (B depends
on A), if multiple values of B exist, then the table has a multi-valued
dependency. Imagine we have an entity with three columns: “student_id”,
“course”, and “hobby”. Both “course” and “hobby” depend on the student
id. A way to fix it is to create two entities: “Student Hobby”, and
“Student Course”. This dependency usually infers that the table has a
combination of columns that don’t belong together. (Why are hobby and
course in the same table?)</li>
</ol>
