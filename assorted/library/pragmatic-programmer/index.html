<h1>Review</h1>
<p>TLDR: This is the kind of book I wish I had read before taking my first job as
a developer. Even though I probably wouldn't get as much from it as I did by
reading it right now.</p>
<p>The Pragmatic Programmer was originally written in 1999. Fast forward to 2022
and the book feels like it was written just yesterday.</p>
<p>I read through this book smiling and nodding all the time, thinking about all
the people in my life that were perfectly tailored to suit the examples (good
and bad) provided by this book.</p>
<p>&quot;How come this feels like history repeating itself? How come the patterns
talked about in this book back in 1999 were propagating all the way towards the
mid 2010's, in all the companies and cultures that I had worked with: Brazil,
Argentina, U.S, New Zealand?&quot; These were just a few questions resonating in the
back of my mind.</p>
<hr>
<p>All in all, what I loved the most about this process was how the book helped me
to become a better professional. Here is a quote that shook me up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I wrote this, and I stand behind my work.&quot; Your signature should come to be
recognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your name on a piece
of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested, and documented. A
really professional job. Written by a real professional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And should we expect anything less? This is what professionalism in the
context of software development is all about. Taking responsibility. Knowing
that testing is not only important, but fundamental. Leaving code better than
it was when you interacted with it for the first time. Understanding the
importance of refactoring. Taking the time to make things good, and to making
them rigt.</p>
<p>The last one on that list has been a stone in my shoe for a very long time. I
am guilty of enjoying delivering things quickly, and in vast amounts. I mean,
who doesn't? I also put myself under the false pretences that if I don't
maintain a decent throughput I am going to be fired, or scrutinised somehow.
That is self-sabotage at its finest, and I am pretty sure a lot of other
programmers feel the same way.</p>
<p>The problem is, every little issue that we leave behind in order to deliver
things quickly, be it a test that you can't bare to write, be it a little
refactoring that you are going to leave until tomorrow (never), means that
someone else will have to get to it later. Reasons may vary, but someone will
have to deal with it and at that point chances are the problem has become
bigger. By ignoring problems and allowing ourselves to go faster individually,
we made everyone else go slow. This doesn't sound very professional, does it?
It's because it is not. It is selfish, and it is not a long term behaviour that
will pay off.</p>
<p>In conclusion I think this is a book I will have to read over and over again so
that the principles and values can be hammered against my brain. Sometimes we
slack off and need to be reminded of good work etiquette and for that we need
to wear our pragmatic programmer hat.</p>
