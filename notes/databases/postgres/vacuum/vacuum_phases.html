<h1>VACUUM Phases</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2025-01-08
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>INITIALIZING</strong>: VACUUM is preparing to begin scanning the heap. This phase
is expected to be very brief.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SCANNING HEAP</strong>: VACUUM is currently scanning the heap. It will prune and
defragment each page if required, and possibly perform freezing activity. The
heap_blks_scanned column can be used to monitor the progress of the scan.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>VACUUMING INDEXES</strong>: VACUUM is currently vacuuming the indexes. If a table
has any indexes, this will happen at least once per vacuum, after the heap
has been completely scanned. It may happen multiple times per vacuum if
maintenance_work_mem (or, in the case of autovacuum, autovacuum_work_mem if
set) is insufficient to store the number of dead tuples found.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>VACUUMING HEAP</strong>: VACUUM is currently vacuuming the heap. Vacuuming the
heap is distinct from scanning the heap, and occurs after each instance of
vacuuming indexes. If heap_blks_scanned is less than heap_blks_total (see
notes below), the system will return to scanning the heap after this phase is
completed; otherwise, it will begin cleaning up indexes after this phase is
completed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CLEANING UP INDEXES</strong>: VACUUM is currently cleaning up indexes. This
occurs after the heap has been completely scanned and all vacuuming of the
indexes and the heap has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TRUNCATING HEAP</strong>: VACUUM is currently truncating the heap so as to return
empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system. This occurs
after cleaning up indexes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PERFORMING FINAL CLEANUP</strong>: VACUUM is performing final cleanup. During this
phase, VACUUM will vacuum the free space map, update statistics in pg_class,
and report statistics to the cumulative statistics system. When this phase is
completed, VACUUM will end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>heap_blks_total: Total number of heap blocks in the table. This number is
reported as of the beginning of the scan; blocks added later will not be (and
need not be) visited by this VACUUM.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Progress Reporting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever VACUUM is running, the pg_stat_progress_vacuum view will contain one
row for each backend (including autovacuum worker processes) that is
currently vacuuming. The tables below describe the information that will be
reported and provide information about how to interpret it. Progress for
VACUUM FULL commands is reported via pg_stat_progress_cluster because both
VACUUM FULL and CLUSTER rewrite the table, while regular VACUUM only modifies
it in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>pg_stat_progress_vacuum</code> View</p>
<p>pid integer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Process ID of backend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>datid oid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OID of the database to which this backend is connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>datname name:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name of the database to which this backend is connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>relid oid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OID of the table being vacuumed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>phase text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current processing phase of vacuum. See Table 27.46.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>heap_blks_total bigint</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total number of heap blocks in the table. This number is reported as of the
beginning of the scan; blocks added later will not be (and need not be)
visited by this VACUUM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>heap_blks_scanned bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of heap blocks scanned. Because the visibility map is used to optimize
scans, some blocks will be skipped without inspection; skipped blocks are
included in this total, so that this number will eventually become equal to
heap_blks_total when the vacuum is complete. This counter only advances when
the phase is scanning heap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>heap_blks_vacuumed bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of heap blocks vacuumed. Unless the table has no indexes, this counter
only advances when the phase is vacuuming heap. Blocks that contain no dead
tuples are skipped, so the counter may sometimes skip forward in large
increments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>index_vacuum_count bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of completed index vacuum cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>max_dead_tuple_bytes bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of dead tuple data that we can store before needing to perform an
index vacuum cycle, based on maintenance_work_mem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>dead_tuple_bytes bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of dead tuple data collected since the last index vacuum cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>num_dead_item_ids bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of dead item identifiers collected since the last index vacuum cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>indexes_total bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Total number of indexes that will be vacuumed or cleaned up. This number is
reported at the beginning of the vacuuming indexes phase or the cleaning up
indexes phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>indexes_processed bigint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of indexes processed. This counter only advances when the phase is
vacuuming indexes or cleaning up indexes.</p>
