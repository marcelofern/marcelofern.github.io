# Putangirua Pinnacles

The Pinnacles track can be done as a day trip from Wellington (2 hours drive
each way). There are two options of tracks:

1. The 4-hour lookout loop. There is a track into the bush that starts just
   after the car park.
2. 40 min each way to the Pinnacles along the (dry) river bank. There is no
   track here, you just go along the river.

One fun fact about this place is that it is where the Dimholt Road scene from
Lord of the Rings was [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYA72GSvtKY).

You can camp here, and this is the view from the car park:

On a clear day you can see the South Island. With the contrast of the sunset
the view becomes even clearer.

Once you start going to the lookout loop track (which I didn't finish) you'll
see good spots to admire the view:

And if you decide to go up the river bank, the walk is mostly on rocky ground:

And it takes about 40 min to reach the final view:
