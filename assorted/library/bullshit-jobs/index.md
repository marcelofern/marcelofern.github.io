# Bullshit Jobs Review

It took me so long to finish this book as I was reading other books at the same
time, which is surprising for such a short book! Fair to say it fell into the
category of books that I read but didn't really pay full attention to.
Nonetheless, the ideas are simple and appealing, so the book was easy to follow
even though I was reading it between many days of interruptions in between.

It seems like some of the statistics presented by the author have been disputed, mainly:

> Although we find that the perception of doing useless work is strongly
> associated with poor wellbeing, our findings contradict the main propositions
> of Graeber’s theory. The proportion of employees describing their jobs as
> useless is low and declining and bears little relationship to Graeber’s
> predictions. Marx’s concept of alienation and a ‘Work Relations’ approach
> provide inspiration for an alternative account that highlights poor
> management and toxic workplace environments in explaining why workers
> perceive paid work as useless.

But also defended, mainly:

> Quantitative research on Europe, however, finds little support for Graeber’s
> theory and claims that alienation may be better suited to explain why people
> consider their jobs socially useless. This study extends previous analyses by
> drawing on a rich, under-utilized dataset and provides new evidence for the
> United States specifically. Contrary to previous studies, it thus finds
> robust support for Graeber’s theory on bullshit jobs. At the same time, it
> also confirms existing evidence on the effects of various other factors,
> including alienation.

Statistics apart, some ideas provide food for thought. The central points are
abut 5 different types of bullshit jobs:

1. Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g.,
   receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store greeters;
2. Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, or to
   prevent other goons from doing so, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers,
   telemarketers, public relations specialists;
3. Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently,
   e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm
   passengers with lost luggage;
4. Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done
   when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house magazine journalists,
   corporate compliance officers, academic administration;
5. Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it, e.g.,
   middle management, leadership professionals.

And the book ends with a recommendation that UBI (universal basic income) could
help out alleviate the number of bullshit jobs in society.

## Quotations

> Provisional Definition: a bullshit job is a form of employment that is so
> completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee
> cannot justify its existence.
>
> As Socrates teaches us, when this happens—when our own definitions produce
> results that seem intuitively wrong to us—it’s because we’re not aware of
> what we really think.
>
> I don’t think I know anyone who has had the same job for thirty years or more
> who doesn’t feel that the bullshit quotient has increased over the time he or
> she has been doing it. I might add that this is certainly true of my own work
> as a professor.
>
> Sigmund Freud even spoke of “housewife’s neurosis”: a condition that he
> believed affected women forced to limit their life horizons to tidying up
> after others, and who therefore became fanatical about domestic hygiene as a
> form of revenge. This is often the moral agony of the duct taper: to be
> forced to organize one’s working life around caring about a certain value
> (say, cleanliness) precisely because more important people could not care
> less.
>
> Peasants and servants obviously were expected to work more steadily. But even
> so, their work schedule was nothing remotely as regular or disciplined as the
> current nine-to-five—the typical medieval serf, male or female, probably
> worked from dawn to dusk for twenty to thirty days out of any year, but just
> a few hours a day otherwise, and on feast days, not at all. And feast days
> were not infrequent.

> Clarence: I worked as a museum guard for a major global security company in a
> museum where one exhibition room was left unused more or less permanently. My
> job was to guard that empty room, ensuring no museum guests touched the …
> well, nothing in the room, and ensure nobody set any fires. To keep my mind
> sharp and attention undivided, I was forbidden any form of mental
> stimulation, like books, phones, etc
> Since nobody was ever there, in practice I sat still and twiddled my thumbs
> for seven and a half hours, waiting for the fire alarm to sound. If it did, I
> was to calmly stand up and walk out. That was it.

> The field of value is always contested territory. It seems that whenever
> there’s a word for something everyone agrees to be desirable—“truth,”
> “beauty,” “love,” “democracy”—then there will be no consensus as to what it
> really means. (Oddly enough, this is even true of money: economists are

> software engineering work was divided between the interesting and challenging
> work of developing core technologies, and the tedious labor of “applying duct

> designers had never bothered to think about their compatibility. His main

> core technologies they get for free. In the end, you can see people doing the
> nongratifying duct-taping work during office hours and then doing gratifying
> work on core technologies during the night. This leads to an interesting
> vicious circle: given that people choose to work on core technologies for
> free, no company is investing in those technologies. The underinvestment
> means that the core technologies are often unfinished, lacking quality, have
> a lot of rough edges, bugs, etc. That, in turn, creates need for duct tape
> and thus proliferation of duct-taping jobs.
