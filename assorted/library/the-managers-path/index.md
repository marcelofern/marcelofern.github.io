There are excellent quotes for a tech manager in this book. The reading is nice
and easy, so good for times where the brain is not running on full pistons.

## Quotes

> As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good
> and bad, is likely to decrease. You are operating at a higher level, and your
> manager is operating at a very high level. Expect the type of feedback to
> change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input.
> It’s even more important as you become more senior that you feel comfortable
> driving your 1-1s and bringing topics for discussion or feedback to your
> manager, because she is otherwise unlikely to spend a lot of time on this
> outside of performance reviews.

> Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you
> to bring solutions, not problems. Try not to make every 1-1 about how you
> need something, how something is wrong, or how you want something more. When
> you have a problem, instead of demanding that your manager solve it for you,
> try asking her for advice on how she might approach the problem.

> There’s a difference between a strong manager and a manager that you like as
> a friend, or even one you respect as an engineer. Plenty of great engineers
> make ineffective managers because they don’t know or want to deal with the
> politics of leadership in their companies. A strong engineer may make a great
> mentor-manager to someone early in his career, but a terrible
> advocate-manager for someone who is more senior.

> So you find yourself mentoring a college student with little real experience.
> How can you make sure that his summer is awesome? Even if your company
> doesn’t love him, you want him to love you, because he’ll go back and tell
> all his friends about the summer he had working for your company.

> Listening is the first and most basic skill of managing people. Listening is
> a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager.
> You need this skill wherever your career takes you; even principal engineers
> with no reports need to be able to hear what others are really saying. So,
> when your mentee is speaking to you, pay attention to your own behavior. Are
> you spending all your time thinking about what you want to say next? Are you
> thinking about your own work? Are you doing anything other than listening to
> the words coming out of his mouth? If so, you’re not listening well.

> The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have
> the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. The
> alpha geek values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits,
> and believes these attributes should determine who gets to make decisions.
> The alpha geek usually can’t deal with dissent, and is easily threatened by
> those she perceives as trying to steal her spotlight or who might upstage
> her. She believes herself to be the best, and responds only to messages that
> support that view. The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence,
> but ends up creating a culture of fear.

> If you’re ever in the position to promote people to management, be very, very
> careful in giving your alpha geeks team management positions, and keep a
> close eye on the impact they have in that role. The alpha geek culture can be
> very harmful to collaboration and can deeply undermine those who feel unable
> to fight back. Alpha geeks who believe that their value comes from knowing
> more than others can also hide information in order to maintain their edge,
> which makes everyone on the team less effective.

> Senior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency
> to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who
> disagrees with what they are saying. To work successfully with a newcomer or
> a more junior teammate, you must be able to listen and communicate in a way
> that person can understand, even if you have to try several times to get it
> right.

> The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most
> experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who
> writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced
> managers fall for. Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the
> freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code. A tech lead who does
> this is not doing her

> The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and
> as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without
> micromanaging. They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to
> increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make
> independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult
> management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner
> effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business. It is
> not required that an engineer work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the
> most common way for engineers to grow from senior engineer 1 -> 2 and is
> required to grow from senior engineer 2 to engineering lead. Realistically it
> is very hard to grow past senior engineer 2 without ever having acted as a
> tech lead, even on the individual contributor track, due to the importance at
> senior levels of leadership and responsibility.

> The work of breaking down a project has a lot of similarity to the work of
> designing systems, and learning this skill is valuable even for engineers who
> don’t want to manage people.

> Becoming a tech lead required me to change my focus. Work is now less about
> me and working on the most technically challenging idea or the most fun
> project; instead, my focus is more on my team. How do I empower them? How do
> I remove the obstacles slowing them down? Working on a rewrite, or some new
> exciting feature that helped me express the full extent of my technical
> prowess, might have been more fun, but what the team needed at the time was
> to tackle technical debt and to focus on operations.

> You also know that it’s important to get your team into a schedule that
> allows them to be focused on development for long stretches of time, because
> they will need to focus for several days on coding problems. Part of your
> leadership is helping the other stakeholders, such as your boss and the
> product manager, respect the team’s focus and set up meeting calendars that
> are not overwhelming for individual contributors.

> In your position as tech lead, you should continue writing code, but not too
> much. Even if you are tempted to pull a rabbit out of the hat yourself, you
> must communicate this obstacle first. Your product manager should know as
> early as possible about any possible challenges. Enlist the help of your
> engineering manager as needed. In a healthy organization, there is no shame
> or harm in raising issues early. Teams often fail because they overworked
> themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to
> compromise on.

> Project management isn’t something that needs to happen in detail for every
> single effort, and it’s overused in some organizations. I don’t even like
> hiring project managers because they often act as a crutch for engineers to
> use instead of learning to think through their future work and ask real
> questions about what they’re doing and why, and their presence means that you
> have more waterfall-style projects instead of an agile process. Still,
> project management has to happen, and as tech lead, you should be doing it
> when it is needed, especially for deeply technical projects.

> Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,
> that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s
> that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth
> before diving in and seeing what happens. A degree of forethought, in places
> where you can reasonably make predictions and plans, is the goal. The plan
> itself, however accurate it turns out, is less important than spending time
> on the act of planning.

> Good managers are looking out for talented people who could be given bigger
> leadership roles, but sometimes this leads them to push people away from
> coding before they’re ready. This practice can have a very negative impact on
> your career, because at more senior levels people who are considered “not
> technical enough” can find it hard to be promoted into management positions
> with more responsibility. It’s much easier to stay in a focused individual
> contributor role and learn what you need to learn there than it is to try to
> learn all of those skills while also learning management skills.

> productivity of the whole team. Often, this means that you pay the price of
> communication overhead. Instead of having every team member sit in a meeting,
> you represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from
> that meeting back to the team. If one universal talent separates successful
> leaders from the pack, it’s communication skills. Successful leaders write
> well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak.
> They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their

> The downfall of the rambling 1-1 is that, if it’s left unchecked, it can turn
> into a complaining session or therapy. Empathetic leaders can sometimes allow
> themselves to get sucked into an unhealthy closeness with their direct
> reports. If you start focusing a lot of energy on hearing reports’ complaints

> have to have a to-do list, but problems in the workplace need to be either
> dealt with or put aside by mutual agreement. There is very little value to
> repeatedly focusing on drama.

> When you get to the stage where you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1
> meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you
> don’t have time to dig into on your own. When you are managing only a handful
> of individuals, the only time you should be using a 1-1 to do progress
> reporting is when you have someone who’s off on a side project that you’re
> not personally overseeing. Getting progress reports from people you’re
> already working closely with is a waste of time because all you’re hearing

> review.

> In the best case, there are a couple of clear themes that run through peer
> feedback, and that you have observed, to comment on. Here are some examples
> of themes that I have seen. There are people who: Struggle with saying no to
> distractions and end up helping with other projects instead of finishing
> their own  Do good work but are hard for others to work with, tending to be
> overly critical or rude in meetings, code reviews, or other collaborative
> activities  Struggle to break their work up into intermediate deliverables,
> and don’t balance planning and design with getting things done  Work well
> with other engineers but do not work well with other departments or teams
> Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team, cut corners, or
> otherwise do sloppy work

> The important thing for you to start doing now that you’re in management is
> to learn how the game is played at your company. Every company has its own
> variation of the promotion process, and you’re probably in this role because
> you survived it. If you don’t know how it’s done, ask your manager for
> advice. How are these decisions made? How early do you need to start
> preparing packets? Are there limits on the number of promotions that can
> happen in any given year? As you learn how to play the game, I encourage you
> to be fairly transparent with your team. When members express the desire to
> be promoted and they don’t have a strong case for promotion, telling them
> what goes into the process will help them understand what they may need to
> change.

> As much as you may want to believe that management is a natural progression

> of skills and challenges.

> if you don’t stay in the code, you risk making yourself technically obsolete
> too early in your career. You may be on a management career path, but that
> doesn’t mean that you should wash your hands of technical responsibilities.
> In fact, I mention specifically in my engineering lead job description that I

> and so smart, but who isn’t a team player and makes everyone around him
> unhappy. (For more on this kind of toxic employee, see “The Brilliant Jerk”.)
> A less critical version of this situation is the person who just stirs up
> drama, who dwells on negative experiences, or who spends a bit too much time
> on gossip and playing games of us-against-them. You have to be brave and nip
> people drama in the bud quickly. It’s OK to ask your manager for help with
> this, especially if it’s your first time doing it, but be aware that your
> manager may actually have an even harder time dealing with the brilliant jerk
> than you do. She isn’t seeing the immediate impact on team dynamics; she’s
> just seeing someone who gets things done. Be prepared to have a series of
> conversations with both the employee and your boss. It may be that a move to
> a different team will clear up the situation.

> Using your managerial power to override technical decisions is usually a bad
> idea. Resist the temptation to micromanage people — especially those who used
> to be your peers. They’re going to be sensitive to the feeling that you’ve
> been “rewarded,” even if they didn’t want to become managers themselves. If
> you question their every move and try to make every single decision yourself,
> you’ll make this sensitivity much worse.

> It’s valuable for everyone to realize that they can and should focus on the

> Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally
> authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process
> is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal
> knowledge of the context. These conditions are rarely met on teams where each
> person has different levels of expertise and different roles. As when the

> problem. Making the wrong person a manager is a mistake, but keeping her in
> that position once you’ve realize she’s wrong for it is a critical error. I

> In almost every model of motivation, people need to feel an understanding and

> they’re doing to achieve them? If not, why not? When you see a team spending
> all of their time on engineering-sponsored projects and neglecting
> product/business projects, it’s likely that the team doesn’t appreciate or
> understand the value of the product/business projects they’re supposed to be
> working on, and therefore they lack the motivation to tackle them.

> Engineers often don’t want to estimate at all, or estimate beyond the
> boundary of an agile sprint (generally two weeks). This philosophy is
> completely reasonable if you believe that estimates must be fairly accurate,
> that the requirements are unknown or will change frequently, and that most of
> the work should be bound to features that mostly fit within one or two sprint
> efforts. With that said, few of these things are always true. Estimates are
> often useful even if they aren’t perfectly accurate because they help
> escalate complexity to the rest of the team. Not every project necessarily
> has requirements that change frequently, and it’s possible to do up-front
> work to drastically reduce the unknowns that make software estimation
> difficult. You may argue that the up-front work sometimes makes the overall
> process take longer than simply looking at the project sprint by sprint, and
> you may be right, but again, we’re not just talking about engineering teams

> Interestingly, Freeman describes a set of circumstances in which the

> Structure grows as the company grows and ages. In fact, there’s even a law

> Be clear about code review expectations. For the most part, code reviews
> don’t catch bugs; tests catch bugs. The exceptions to this rule are that code
> review can catch missing updates to comments or documentation or missing
> changes to related features, and code reviewers can sometimes tell when there
> is inadequate testing of the new or changed code. Code review is largely a
> socialization exercise, so that multiple team members have seen and are aware
> of the changed code.

> Use a linter for style issues. Engineers can waste absurd amounts of time on
> questions of style, specifically formatting. This should not be up for debate
> in code review. Decide on a style, and put that style into a linter that
> formats the code automatically. Allowing style to be up for discussion in
> code review often leads to nitpicking and criticism that can feel
> unproductive at best, and bullying at worst.

> Resist the urge to point fingers and blame. It is incredibly tempting, after
> a stressful outage, to point fingers and ask people why they failed to
> foresee the consequences of their behavior. Why did they run that command on
> that box? Why didn’t they test that? Why did they ignore that alert?
> Unfortunately, this blaming only results in people being afraid to make
> mistakes.
