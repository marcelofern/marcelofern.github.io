<h1>Long Transactions</h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Long-running&quot; is a relative term, and, of course, its meaning depends on
particular situation. Usually, in heavily-loaded systems – say ~10^5 TPS
including RO queries and ~10^3 of XID-consuming TPS (writes) – we consider
transactions running longer than 30-60 seconds to be long. This can be
translated to 30-60k dead tuples accumulated in a table in the worst case –
in the case when all transactions during that time frame produced 1 dead
tuple. Of course, this is a very, very rough assumption, but this can give an
idea about the scale and helps define &quot;threshold&quot; to support the meaning of
the &quot;long-running transaction&quot; term. <a href="notes/https://github.com/postgres-ai/postgres-howtos/blob/main/0030_how_to_deal_with_long-running_transactions_oltp.html">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why are they bad</h2>
<p>In the context of a web application, long-running transactions can be dangerous
for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking: A lock acquired during a transaction will only be released when
the transaction finishes. This can be dangerous even in cases where the lock
acquired is the weakest one possible: AccessShareLock. This is the case when
a DDL is blocked by this lock, and in turn blocks other queries that need to
run.</li>
<li>Autovacuum: Dead tuples that have been created after the long-running
transaction started cannot be reclaimed by autovacuum. A high number of
dead tuples in a table can seriously affect the performance of queries
against that table.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to prevent them</h2>
<p>When using Postgres 17 or higher, you can se the transaction_timeout value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SET transaction_timeout TO '30s';
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you can achieve something close to that with two parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>statement_timeout</code>: If you have a web application and pages that take more
than 30s to load time out, 30s might be a good value for this parameter. You
might need to have a higher value for batch tasks, which can be controlled
via user roles.</li>
<li><code>idle_in_transaction_session_timeout</code>: Terminate any session that has been
idle (that is, waiting for a client query) within an open transaction for
longer than the specified amount of time. This should also be set to a low
value like 15-30 seconds for a web application.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that even with these two parameters, it's not a guarantee that no
long-running queries will show up. The following could happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of <code>statement_timeou</code> is set to 30s, and
<code>idle_in_transaction_session_timeout</code> is set to 15s.</li>
<li>A transaction is opened.</li>
<li>A query runs and takes 29 seconds.</li>
<li>It is idle for 14s.</li>
<li>Another query runs and takes 29 seconds.</li>
<li>It is idle for 14s.</li>
<li>... so on so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other alternatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cronjob that runs a long-running transaction &quot;killer&quot;.</li>
<li>Add the limit in the application side if you can.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Showing low-running transactions:</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select clock_timestamp() - xact_start, *
from pg_stat_activity
where clock_timestamp() - xact_start &gt; interval '1 minute'
order by clock_timestamp() - xact_start desc;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also sample the queries for this long-running transaction to show what
they were doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">while sleep 1; do
  psql -XAtc &quot;
      copy (
        with samples as (
          select
            clock_timestamp(),
            clock_timestamp() - xact_start as xact_duration,
            *
          from pg_stat_activity
        )
        select *
        from samples
        where xact_duration &gt; interval '1 minute'
        order by xact_duration desc
      ) to stdout delimiter ',' csv
    &quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 \
  | tee -a long_tx_$(date +%Y%m%d).log.csv
done
</code></pre>
