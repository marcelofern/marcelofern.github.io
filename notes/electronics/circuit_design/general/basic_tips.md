1. Do not rely on specific component values. Firstly, components themselves are
   of finite precision. For example, resistors fall into the ±5% to ±1% range.
   Whereas capacitor the range is typically ±10% or ±5%. Secondly, a good
   circuit will have robust insensitivity to precise values of components.
2. Be good at "circuit intuition". Meaning, be quick to perform approximate
   calculations to understand a circuit quickly.
