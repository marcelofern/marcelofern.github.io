<h1>Review: The Manager's Path</h1>
<pre><code class="language-">Created at: 2024-10-01
</code></pre><p>There are excellent quotes for a tech manager in this book. The reading is nice and easy, so good for times where the brain is not running on full pistons.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good</blockquote>
<blockquote>and bad, is likely to decrease. You are operating at a higher level, and your</blockquote>
<blockquote>manager is operating at a very high level. Expect the type of feedback to</blockquote>
<blockquote>change somewhat from personal feedback to team- or strategy-related input.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s even more important as you become more senior that you feel comfortable</blockquote>
<blockquote>driving your 1-1s and bringing topics for discussion or feedback to your</blockquote>
<blockquote>manager, because she is otherwise unlikely to spend a lot of time on this</blockquote>
<blockquote>outside of performance reviews.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you</blockquote>
<blockquote>to bring solutions, not problems. Try not to make every 1-1 about how you</blockquote>
<blockquote>need something, how something is wrong, or how you want something more. When</blockquote>
<blockquote>you have a problem, instead of demanding that your manager solve it for you,</blockquote>
<blockquote>try asking her for advice on how she might approach the problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There’s a difference between a strong manager and a manager that you like as</blockquote>
<blockquote>a friend, or even one you respect as an engineer. Plenty of great engineers</blockquote>
<blockquote>make ineffective managers because they don’t know or want to deal with the</blockquote>
<blockquote>politics of leadership in their companies. A strong engineer may make a great</blockquote>
<blockquote>mentor-manager to someone early in his career, but a terrible</blockquote>
<blockquote>advocate-manager for someone who is more senior.</blockquote>
<blockquote>So you find yourself mentoring a college student with little real experience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>How can you make sure that his summer is awesome? Even if your company</blockquote>
<blockquote>doesn’t love him, you want him to love you, because he’ll go back and tell</blockquote>
<blockquote>all his friends about the summer he had working for your company.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Listening is the first and most basic skill of managing people. Listening is</blockquote>
<blockquote>a precursor to empathy, which is one of the core skills of a quality manager.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You need this skill wherever your career takes you; even principal engineers</blockquote>
<blockquote>with no reports need to be able to hear what others are really saying. So,</blockquote>
<blockquote>when your mentee is speaking to you, pay attention to your own behavior. Are</blockquote>
<blockquote>you spending all your time thinking about what you want to say next? Are you</blockquote>
<blockquote>thinking about your own work? Are you doing anything other than listening to</blockquote>
<blockquote>the words coming out of his mouth? If so, you’re not listening well.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The alpha geek is driven to be the best engineer on the team, to always have</blockquote>
<blockquote>the right answer, and to be the person who solves all the hard problems. The</blockquote>
<blockquote>alpha geek values intelligence and technical skill above all other traits,</blockquote>
<blockquote>and believes these attributes should determine who gets to make decisions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The alpha geek usually can’t deal with dissent, and is easily threatened by</blockquote>
<blockquote>those she perceives as trying to steal her spotlight or who might upstage</blockquote>
<blockquote>her. She believes herself to be the best, and responds only to messages that</blockquote>
<blockquote>support that view. The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence,</blockquote>
<blockquote>but ends up creating a culture of fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you’re ever in the position to promote people to management, be very, very</blockquote>
<blockquote>careful in giving your alpha geeks team management positions, and keep a</blockquote>
<blockquote>close eye on the impact they have in that role. The alpha geek culture can be</blockquote>
<blockquote>very harmful to collaboration and can deeply undermine those who feel unable</blockquote>
<blockquote>to fight back. Alpha geeks who believe that their value comes from knowing</blockquote>
<blockquote>more than others can also hide information in order to maintain their edge,</blockquote>
<blockquote>which makes everyone on the team less effective.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Senior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency</blockquote>
<blockquote>to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who</blockquote>
<blockquote>disagrees with what they are saying. To work successfully with a newcomer or</blockquote>
<blockquote>a more junior teammate, you must be able to listen and communicate in a way</blockquote>
<blockquote>that person can understand, even if you have to try several times to get it</blockquote>
<blockquote>right.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most</blockquote>
<blockquote>experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who</blockquote>
<blockquote>writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced</blockquote>
<blockquote>managers fall for. Tech lead is not the job for the person who wants the</blockquote>
<blockquote>freedom to focus deeply on the details of her own code. A tech lead who does</blockquote>
<blockquote>this is not doing her</blockquote>
<blockquote>The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without</blockquote>
<blockquote>micromanaging. They focus on the whole team’s productivity and strive to</blockquote>
<blockquote>increase the impact of the team’s work product. They are empowered to make</blockquote>
<blockquote>independent decisions for the team and are learning how to handle difficult</blockquote>
<blockquote>management and leadership situations. They are also learning how to partner</blockquote>
<blockquote>effectively with product, analytics, and other areas of the business. It is</blockquote>
<blockquote>not required that an engineer work as a tech lead to progress, but it is the</blockquote>
<blockquote>most common way for engineers to grow from senior engineer 1 -> 2 and is</blockquote>
<blockquote>required to grow from senior engineer 2 to engineering lead. Realistically it</blockquote>
<blockquote>is very hard to grow past senior engineer 2 without ever having acted as a</blockquote>
<blockquote>tech lead, even on the individual contributor track, due to the importance at</blockquote>
<blockquote>senior levels of leadership and responsibility.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The work of breaking down a project has a lot of similarity to the work of</blockquote>
<blockquote>designing systems, and learning this skill is valuable even for engineers who</blockquote>
<blockquote>don’t want to manage people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Becoming a tech lead required me to change my focus. Work is now less about</blockquote>
<blockquote>me and working on the most technically challenging idea or the most fun</blockquote>
<blockquote>project; instead, my focus is more on my team. How do I empower them? How do</blockquote>
<blockquote>I remove the obstacles slowing them down? Working on a rewrite, or some new</blockquote>
<blockquote>exciting feature that helped me express the full extent of my technical</blockquote>
<blockquote>prowess, might have been more fun, but what the team needed at the time was</blockquote>
<blockquote>to tackle technical debt and to focus on operations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You also know that it’s important to get your team into a schedule that</blockquote>
<blockquote>allows them to be focused on development for long stretches of time, because</blockquote>
<blockquote>they will need to focus for several days on coding problems. Part of your</blockquote>
<blockquote>leadership is helping the other stakeholders, such as your boss and the</blockquote>
<blockquote>product manager, respect the team’s focus and set up meeting calendars that</blockquote>
<blockquote>are not overwhelming for individual contributors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In your position as tech lead, you should continue writing code, but not too</blockquote>
<blockquote>much. Even if you are tempted to pull a rabbit out of the hat yourself, you</blockquote>
<blockquote>must communicate this obstacle first. Your product manager should know as</blockquote>
<blockquote>early as possible about any possible challenges. Enlist the help of your</blockquote>
<blockquote>engineering manager as needed. In a healthy organization, there is no shame</blockquote>
<blockquote>or harm in raising issues early. Teams often fail because they overworked</blockquote>
<blockquote>themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to</blockquote>
<blockquote>compromise on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Project management isn’t something that needs to happen in detail for every</blockquote>
<blockquote>single effort, and it’s overused in some organizations. I don’t even like</blockquote>
<blockquote>hiring project managers because they often act as a crutch for engineers to</blockquote>
<blockquote>use instead of learning to think through their future work and ask real</blockquote>
<blockquote>questions about what they’re doing and why, and their presence means that you</blockquote>
<blockquote>have more waterfall-style projects instead of an agile process. Still,</blockquote>
<blockquote>project management has to happen, and as tech lead, you should be doing it</blockquote>
<blockquote>when it is needed, especially for deeply technical projects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ultimately, the value of planning isn’t that you execute the plan perfectly,</blockquote>
<blockquote>that you catch every detail beforehand, or that you predict the future; it’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>that you enforce the self-discipline to think about the project in some depth</blockquote>
<blockquote>before diving in and seeing what happens. A degree of forethought, in places</blockquote>
<blockquote>where you can reasonably make predictions and plans, is the goal. The plan</blockquote>
<blockquote>itself, however accurate it turns out, is less important than spending time</blockquote>
<blockquote>on the act of planning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Good managers are looking out for talented people who could be given bigger</blockquote>
<blockquote>leadership roles, but sometimes this leads them to push people away from</blockquote>
<blockquote>coding before they’re ready. This practice can have a very negative impact on</blockquote>
<blockquote>your career, because at more senior levels people who are considered “not</blockquote>
<blockquote>technical enough” can find it hard to be promoted into management positions</blockquote>
<blockquote>with more responsibility. It’s much easier to stay in a focused individual</blockquote>
<blockquote>contributor role and learn what you need to learn there than it is to try to</blockquote>
<blockquote>learn all of those skills while also learning management skills.</blockquote>
<blockquote>productivity of the whole team. Often, this means that you pay the price of</blockquote>
<blockquote>communication overhead. Instead of having every team member sit in a meeting,</blockquote>
<blockquote>you represent the team, communicate their needs, and bring information from</blockquote>
<blockquote>that meeting back to the team. If one universal talent separates successful</blockquote>
<blockquote>leaders from the pack, it’s communication skills. Successful leaders write</blockquote>
<blockquote>well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak.</blockquote>
<blockquote>They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their</blockquote>
<blockquote>knowledge and the knowledge of the team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>is to help their new reports create a 30/60/90-day plan. This can include</blockquote>
<blockquote>basic goals, like getting up to speed on the code, committing a bug fix, or</blockquote>
<blockquote>performing a release, and is especially valuable for new hires and people</blockquote>
<blockquote>transferring from other areas of the company. The more senior the hire, the</blockquote>
<blockquote>more he should participate in creating this plan. You want him to have some</blockquote>
<blockquote>clear goals that will show whether he’s learning the right things as he gets</blockquote>
<blockquote>up to speed. These goals will also require some work from you and from the</blockquote>
<blockquote>team, because it’s very rare that everything is self-evident, well</blockquote>
<blockquote>documented, and totally obvious to a newcomer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another approach that many experienced managers use is to help their new</blockquote>
<blockquote>reports create a 30/60/90-day plan. This can include basic goals, like</blockquote>

<blockquote>These goals will also require some work from you and from the team, because</blockquote>
<blockquote>it’s very rare that everything is self-evident, well documented, and totally</blockquote>
<blockquote>obvious to a newcomer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Regular 1-1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on</blockquote>
<blockquote>the side of the highway at the worst possible time. Marc Hedlund</blockquote>
<blockquote>The downfall of the rambling 1-1 is that, if it’s left unchecked, it can turn</blockquote>
<blockquote>into a complaining session or therapy. Empathetic leaders can sometimes allow</blockquote>
<blockquote>themselves to get sucked into an unhealthy closeness with their direct</blockquote>
<blockquote>reports. If you start focusing a lot of energy on hearing reports’ complaints</blockquote>
<blockquote>and commiserating, you’re quite possibly making the problem worse. You don’t</blockquote>
<blockquote>have to have a to-do list, but problems in the workplace need to be either</blockquote>
<blockquote>dealt with or put aside by mutual agreement. There is very little value to</blockquote>
<blockquote>repeatedly focusing on drama.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you get to the stage where you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1</blockquote>
<blockquote>meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you</blockquote>
<blockquote>don’t have time to dig into on your own. When you are managing only a handful</blockquote>
<blockquote>of individuals, the only time you should be using a 1-1 to do progress</blockquote>
<blockquote>reporting is when you have someone who’s off on a side project that you’re</blockquote>
<blockquote>not personally overseeing. Getting progress reports from people you’re</blockquote>
<blockquote>already working closely with is a waste of time because all you’re hearing</blockquote>
<blockquote>about is the delta of work between now and the last standup or project</blockquote>
<blockquote>review.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the best case, there are a couple of clear themes that run through peer</blockquote>
<blockquote>feedback, and that you have observed, to comment on. Here are some examples</blockquote>
<blockquote>of themes that I have seen. There are people who: Struggle with saying no to</blockquote>
<blockquote>distractions and end up helping with other projects instead of finishing</blockquote>
<blockquote>their own  Do good work but are hard for others to work with, tending to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>overly critical or rude in meetings, code reviews, or other collaborative</blockquote>
<blockquote>activities  Struggle to break their work up into intermediate deliverables,</blockquote>
<blockquote>and don’t balance planning and design with getting things done  Work well</blockquote>
<blockquote>with other engineers but do not work well with other departments or teams</blockquote>
<blockquote>Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team, cut corners, or</blockquote>
<blockquote>otherwise do sloppy work</blockquote>
<blockquote>The important thing for you to start doing now that you’re in management is</blockquote>
<blockquote>to learn how the game is played at your company. Every company has its own</blockquote>
<blockquote>variation of the promotion process, and you’re probably in this role because</blockquote>
<blockquote>you survived it. If you don’t know how it’s done, ask your manager for</blockquote>
<blockquote>advice. How are these decisions made? How early do you need to start</blockquote>
<blockquote>preparing packets? Are there limits on the number of promotions that can</blockquote>
<blockquote>happen in any given year? As you learn how to play the game, I encourage you</blockquote>
<blockquote>to be fairly transparent with your team. When members express the desire to</blockquote>
<blockquote>be promoted and they don’t have a strong case for promotion, telling them</blockquote>
<blockquote>what goes into the process will help them understand what they may need to</blockquote>
<blockquote>change.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As much as you may want to believe that management is a natural progression</blockquote>
<blockquote>of the skills you develop as a senior engineer, it’s really a whole new set</blockquote>
<blockquote>of skills and challenges.</blockquote>
<blockquote>if you don’t stay in the code, you risk making yourself technically obsolete</blockquote>
<blockquote>too early in your career. You may be on a management career path, but that</blockquote>
<blockquote>doesn’t mean that you should wash your hands of technical responsibilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In fact, I mention specifically in my engineering lead job description that I</blockquote>
<blockquote>expect managers at this level to implement small features and bug fixes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometimes we let ourselves hang onto that brilliant asshole for too long. You</blockquote>
<blockquote>know, that person you think can’t be replaced because he’s just so productive</blockquote>
<blockquote>and so smart, but who isn’t a team player and makes everyone around him</blockquote>
<blockquote>unhappy. (For more on this kind of toxic employee, see “The Brilliant Jerk”.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>A less critical version of this situation is the person who just stirs up</blockquote>
<blockquote>drama, who dwells on negative experiences, or who spends a bit too much time</blockquote>
<blockquote>on gossip and playing games of us-against-them. You have to be brave and nip</blockquote>
<blockquote>people drama in the bud quickly. It’s OK to ask your manager for help with</blockquote>
<blockquote>this, especially if it’s your first time doing it, but be aware that your</blockquote>
<blockquote>manager may actually have an even harder time dealing with the brilliant jerk</blockquote>
<blockquote>than you do. She isn’t seeing the immediate impact on team dynamics; she’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>just seeing someone who gets things done. Be prepared to have a series of</blockquote>
<blockquote>conversations with both the employee and your boss. It may be that a move to</blockquote>
<blockquote>a different team will clear up the situation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Using your managerial power to override technical decisions is usually a bad</blockquote>
<blockquote>idea. Resist the temptation to micromanage people — especially those who used</blockquote>
<blockquote>to be your peers. They’re going to be sensitive to the feeling that you’ve</blockquote>
<blockquote>been “rewarded,” even if they didn’t want to become managers themselves. If</blockquote>
<blockquote>you question their every move and try to make every single decision yourself,</blockquote>
<blockquote>you’ll make this sensitivity much worse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s valuable for everyone to realize that they can and should focus on the</blockquote>
<blockquote>things they can impact and change, and ignore the things they can’t. Drama in</blockquote>
<blockquote>the workplace is usually little more than an ego-entertaining drain.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally</blockquote>
<blockquote>authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process</blockquote>
<blockquote>is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal</blockquote>
<blockquote>knowledge of the context. These conditions are rarely met on teams where each</blockquote>
<blockquote>person has different levels of expertise and different roles. As when the</blockquote>
<blockquote>team voted down Charles’s work, consensus can be downright cruel. Don’t set</blockquote>
<blockquote>people up for votes that you know will fail instead of taking the</blockquote>
<blockquote>responsibility as a manager of delivering that bad news yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>avoidant managers often seek conflict when it comes to other teams. They</blockquote>
<blockquote>identify strongly with their own team and will aggressively react to what</blockquote>
<blockquote>they perceive as threats from outsiders. When something goes wrong, like an</blockquote>
<blockquote>incident that spans across teams, the manager turns into a bully and demands</blockquote>
<blockquote>justice for his team, or blames the problems on the other team. Sometimes,</blockquote>
<blockquote>this behavior is an outlet for the manager’s suppressed feelings about his</blockquote>
<blockquote>own team. As one friend put it, “I was not telling my people the 10% of</blockquote>
<blockquote>things they needed to be improving because I was afraid they would miss the</blockquote>
<blockquote>message about the 90% of things that were good, and so I took that desire for</blockquote>
<blockquote>accountability out on other teams. I really just wanted everyone to be fully</blockquote>
<blockquote>accountable, and I needed to figure out how to express that internally and</blockquote>
<blockquote>externally in a healthy manner.”  Do remember to be kind. It’s natural</blockquote>
<blockquote>Don’t take it out on other teams. Ironically, conflict-avoidant managers</blockquote>
<blockquote>often seek conflict when it comes to other teams. They identify strongly with</blockquote>
<blockquote>their own team and will aggressively react to what they perceive as threats</blockquote>
<blockquote>from outsiders. When something goes wrong, like an incident that spans across</blockquote>
<blockquote>teams, the manager turns into a bully and demands justice for his team, or</blockquote>

<blockquote>The real goal here is psychological safety — that is, a team whose members</blockquote>
<blockquote>are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. This is</blockquote>
<blockquote>the underpinning of a successful team. The work of gelling a team begins by</blockquote>
<blockquote>creating the friendliness that leads to psychological safety.</blockquote>
<blockquote>who, as we discussed earlier, produces individually outsized results, but is</blockquote>

<blockquote>everyone around her. The challenge of the brilliant jerk is that she’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>probably been rewarded for a very long time for her brilliance, and she</blockquote>

<blockquote>convince her that her behavior is a problem. All the evidence in the world</blockquote>
<blockquote>can’t change a person who doesn’t want to change.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter There are</blockquote>
<blockquote>52 weeks in a year, or about 13 per quarter. However, realistically your team</blockquote>
<blockquote>will lose a lot of that time. Vacations, meetings, review season, production</blockquote>
<blockquote>outages, onboarding new employees — all of these things take away from focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board</blockquote>
<blockquote>By “generic sustaining engineering work,” I mean testing, debugging, cleaning</blockquote>
<blockquote>up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, and doing other work</blockquote>
<blockquote>that has to happen. If you make this a habit, you can use it to tackle some</blockquote>
<blockquote>of the midsize legacy code every quarter and get decent improvements.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Cleaning up systems as you go keeps those systems easy to work in, which</blockquote>
<blockquote>keeps your teams moving forward on new features. In the worst case, you can</blockquote>
<blockquote>use this slack to smooth over unexpected delays in feature development, but</blockquote>
<blockquote>if you fill the schedule to 100% with feature development, expect that the</blockquote>
<blockquote>feature development will quickly slow down as a result of this</blockquote>
<blockquote>overscheduling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>previous level is that your boss will expect you to be mature enough to</blockquote>
<blockquote>manage yourself and your teams independently. This means that your manager</blockquote>
<blockquote>trusts you to proactively deal with all those important but not urgent things</blockquote>
<blockquote>before they become urgent, and especially before they become urgent for your</blockquote>
<blockquote>manager. No one will tell you how to manage</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the major changes at this level compared to the previous level is that</blockquote>
<blockquote>your boss will expect you to be mature enough to manage yourself and your</blockquote>
<blockquote>teams independently. This means that your manager trusts you to proactively</blockquote>
<blockquote>deal with all those important but not urgent things before they become</blockquote>
<blockquote>urgent, and especially before they become urgent for your manager. No one</blockquote>
<blockquote>will tell you how to manage your calendar to give yourself the time to do</blockquote>
<blockquote>this. I’ve seen managers fail at this point because they just could not</blockquote>
<blockquote>juggle all the different tasks in an organized fashion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>engineer, you have to accept that being that manager means that you by</blockquote>
<blockquote>definition can’t be that engineer. I know some people manage both, but you</blockquote>
<blockquote>need to decide, if you’re going to suck at one, which one that will be. I</blockquote>
<blockquote>feel bad when I suck at being an engineer, but sucking at being a manager</blockquote>
<blockquote>would be a choice I inflicted on other people. That’s not fair. So at the end</blockquote>
<blockquote>of another day when I feel like I didn’t write enough code and I have no way</blockquote>

<blockquote>carefully about dropping out of meetings, and part of the reason is that</blockquote>
<blockquote>those meetings are where you learn what healthy and unhealthy dynamics look</blockquote>

<blockquote>strongly advise you maintain your practice of regular, reliable 1-1 meetings</blockquote>
<blockquote>with everyone who reports directly to you. If you have too many people, you</blockquote>
<blockquote>may need to shorten those meetings or hold them biweekly instead of weekly,</blockquote>
<blockquote>but skipping 1-1s because you’re too busy with other things is a great way to</blockquote>
<blockquote>miss the warning signs of an employee who is going to quit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Delegation is a process that starts slow but turns into the essential element</blockquote>
<blockquote>for career growth. If you teams can’t operate well without you around, you’ll</blockquote>
<blockquote>find it hard to be promoted. Develop your talent and push decisions down to</blockquote>
<blockquote>that talent so that you can find new and interesting plates to learn how to</blockquote>
<blockquote>spin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Saying no to your boss rarely looks like a simple “no” when you’re a manager.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Instead, it looks like the “yes, and” technique of improvisational comedy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Yes, we can do that project, and all we will need to do is delay the start</blockquote>
<blockquote>of this other project that is currently on the roadmap.” Responding with</blockquote>
<blockquote>positivity while still articulating the boundaries of reality will get you</blockquote>
<blockquote>into the major leagues of senior leadership. This type of positive no is a</blockquote>
<blockquote>pretty hard skill for most engineers to master.</blockquote>
<blockquote>discusses several questions you can answer to help predict team productivity</blockquote>
<blockquote>and satisfaction. Among them are: Do I know what is expected of me at work?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?  Do I have</blockquote>
<blockquote>the opportunity to do what I do best every day?</blockquote>
<blockquote>your team’s ability to do what they do best every day. Overfocusing on</blockquote>
<blockquote>building systems that are defect-free, or pushing for error prevention by</blockquote>
<blockquote>slowing down the development process, is often almost as bad as moving too</blockquote>
<blockquote>fast and releasing</blockquote>
<blockquote>An overemphasis on incident prevention can also reduce your team’s ability to</blockquote>
<blockquote>do what they do best every day. Overfocusing on building systems that are</blockquote>
<blockquote>defect-free, or pushing for error prevention by slowing down the development</blockquote>
<blockquote>process, is often almost as bad as moving too fast and releasing unstable</blockquote>
<blockquote>code. When risk reduction turns into weeks of manual QA, excessive and slow</blockquote>
<blockquote>code reviews, infrequent releases, or a drawn-out planning process, the</blockquote>
<blockquote>increased analysis can leave developers idle and restless, without</blockquote>
<blockquote>necessarily reducing the risk of incidents.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you’re managing a people pleaser, one of the best things you can do is</blockquote>
<blockquote>show the person that he’s exhibiting the behavior, and highlight the</blockquote>
<blockquote>downsides. Sometimes all it takes is awareness that his habit of saying yes</blockquote>
<blockquote>is a problem for the team. Recognize that this usually comes from a personal</blockquote>
<blockquote>value of being selfless and caring about others, and honor these values even</blockquote>
<blockquote>as you try to correct the unhealthy behaviors. People pleasers, after all,</blockquote>
<blockquote>just want to make you happy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As you may remember from your first time managing a team, you don’t know what</blockquote>
<blockquote>you don’t know. You probably did whatever good managers had done with you in</blockquote>
<blockquote>the past, if you had a good manager to emulate. Perhaps you got a little</blockquote>
<blockquote>training or read a book like this one, but more likely you muddled your way</blockquote>
<blockquote>through it. Unless, of course, you had a good manager yourself helping you</blockquote>
<blockquote>learn the ropes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Overwork is also often a sign of another new manager danger: the person who</blockquote>
<blockquote>thinks she’s now in control, the taskmaster of the team, responsible for</blockquote>
<blockquote>making all of the decisions. Managers who neglect the job are bad, but</blockquote>
<blockquote>managers who take to the job with gusto because they believe it’s the key to</blockquote>
<blockquote>realizing authority are sometimes even worse. A manager on a power trip</blockquote>
<blockquote>domineers her team, and a skip-level meeting with more senior members of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>team will reveal their frustration that they have no ability to make</blockquote>
<blockquote>decisions themselves. This is slightly different from but related to the</blockquote>

<blockquote>First-time managers are tricky because if they truly don’t have the</blockquote>
<blockquote>willingness to learn and aptitude to become solid managers, they’re a big</blockquote>
<blockquote>problem. Making the wrong person a manager is a mistake, but keeping her in</blockquote>
<blockquote>that position once you’ve realize she’s wrong for it is a critical error. I</blockquote>
<blockquote>am hugely in favor of making engineers who wish to go into management take</blockquote>
<blockquote>baby steps of mentoring and managing very small teams, but this is not always</blockquote>
<blockquote>possible and doesn’t always shake out problems that come with scale. Control</blockquote>
<blockquote>freak managers, for example, don’t often show up as clearly in smaller</blockquote>
<blockquote>management situations, instead holding that impulse back until they feel they</blockquote>
<blockquote>have the true authority of title. Keep an eye on your new managers. You may</blockquote>
<blockquote>need to provide not only coaching but strong corrective feedback in the first</blockquote>
<blockquote>six months.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In almost every model of motivation, people need to feel an understanding and</blockquote>
<blockquote>connection with the purpose of their work. Who are they building these</blockquote>
<blockquote>systems for; what is the potential impact on the customer, the business, the</blockquote>
<blockquote>team? Did they have any part in deciding these goals, and the projects that</blockquote>
<blockquote>they’re doing to achieve them? If not, why not? When you see a team spending</blockquote>
<blockquote>all of their time on engineering-sponsored projects and neglecting</blockquote>
<blockquote>product/business projects, it’s likely that the team doesn’t appreciate or</blockquote>
<blockquote>understand the value of the product/business projects they’re supposed to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>working on, and therefore they lack the motivation to tackle them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Engineers often don’t want to estimate at all, or estimate beyond the</blockquote>
<blockquote>boundary of an agile sprint (generally two weeks). This philosophy is</blockquote>
<blockquote>completely reasonable if you believe that estimates must be fairly accurate,</blockquote>
<blockquote>that the requirements are unknown or will change frequently, and that most of</blockquote>
<blockquote>the work should be bound to features that mostly fit within one or two sprint</blockquote>
<blockquote>efforts. With that said, few of these things are always true. Estimates are</blockquote>
<blockquote>often useful even if they aren’t perfectly accurate because they help</blockquote>
<blockquote>escalate complexity to the rest of the team. Not every project necessarily</blockquote>
<blockquote>has requirements that change frequently, and it’s possible to do up-front</blockquote>
<blockquote>work to drastically reduce the unknowns that make software estimation</blockquote>
<blockquote>difficult. You may argue that the up-front work sometimes makes the overall</blockquote>
<blockquote>process take longer than simply looking at the project sprint by sprint, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>you may be right, but again, we’re not just talking about engineering teams</blockquote>
<blockquote>here. We’re talking about businesses that want to plan and get ideas of costs</blockquote>
<blockquote>for effort. We’re also, in some sense, talking about goal setting and</blockquote>
<blockquote>learning how to get better at understanding the complexity of our software</blockquote>
<blockquote>and systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dedicate 20% of your team’s schedule to “sustaining engineering.” This means</blockquote>
<blockquote>allowing time for refactoring, fixing outstanding bugs, improving engineering</blockquote>
<blockquote>processes, doing minor cleanup, and providing ongoing support. Take this into</blockquote>
<blockquote>account in every planning session. Unfortunately, 20% is not enough to do big</blockquote>
<blockquote>projects, so additional planning will be needed to get major technical</blockquote>
<blockquote>rewrites or other big technical improvements. But without that 20% time,</blockquote>
<blockquote>there will be negative consequences with missed delivery goals and unplanned</blockquote>
<blockquote>and unpleasant cleanup work.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When an engineer comes to you with an engineering project that she wants to</blockquote>
<blockquote>do, think about framing the project by answering these questions:  How big is</blockquote>
<blockquote>that project? How important is it? Can you articulate the value of that</blockquote>
<blockquote>project to anyone who asks? What would successful completion of the project</blockquote>
<blockquote>mean for the team?</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’ll leave you with some advice my own VP of Engineering once gave me:</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Wanting to be a CTO (or VP of Engineering) is like wanting to be married.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Remember that it’s not just the title, it’s also the company and the people</blockquote>
<blockquote>that matter.” Titles are definitely not everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It can come from placing a high value on being correct and following the</blockquote>
<blockquote>rules, and having a strong affinity for hierarchy-based leadership. I also</blockquote>
<blockquote>believe that coming from places where conflict was openly tolerated, if not</blockquote>
<blockquote>actively encouraged, made me even more likely to create this culture.</blockquote>
<blockquote>How do you know if you’re creating a culture of fear? It can come from</blockquote>
<blockquote>placing a high value on being correct and following the rules, and having a</blockquote>
<blockquote>strong affinity for hierarchy-based leadership. I also believe that coming</blockquote>
<blockquote>from places where conflict was openly tolerated, if not actively encouraged,</blockquote>
<blockquote>made me even more likely to create this culture.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Apologies don’t need to be drawn-out affairs. A short apology that takes</blockquote>
<blockquote>responsibility for your role in creating a negative situation or hurting</blockquote>
<blockquote>another person is all that is necessary. If you go too long, it often turns</blockquote>
<blockquote>into an excuse or a distraction. The goal with apologizing is to show people</blockquote>
<blockquote>that you know your behavior has an impact on others, and to role-model for</blockquote>
<blockquote>them that it’s OK to make a mistake but that you should apologize when you</blockquote>
<blockquote>hurt other people. You’re showing the team that apologizing doesn’t make you</blockquote>
<blockquote>weaker — it makes the whole team stronger.</blockquote>
<blockquote>is a piece called “The Tyranny of Structurelessness” by Jo Freeman. While the</blockquote>
<blockquote>article is about early feminist/anarchist collectives, Freeman’s insights</blockquote>
<blockquote>apply equally well to startup culture. Pretending to lack structure tends to</blockquote>
<blockquote>create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human</blockquote>
<blockquote>communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Interestingly, Freeman describes a set of circumstances in which the</blockquote>
<blockquote>unstructured group can, in fact, work:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Structure grows as the company grows and ages. In fact, there’s even a law</blockquote>
<blockquote>that accounts for this, from John Gall’s book Systemantics:1 A complex system</blockquote>
<blockquote>that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that</blockquote>
<blockquote>worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be</blockquote>
<blockquote>patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple</blockquote>
<blockquote>system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When every new hire slows the team down for months because there is no</blockquote>
<blockquote>onboarding process, that is a failure due to lack of structure. When people</blockquote>
<blockquote>regularly leave the company because they have no path to advancement or</blockquote>
<blockquote>career growth, that is a failure due to lack of structure. The third time you</blockquote>
<blockquote>have a production outage because someone logged directly into the database</blockquote>
<blockquote>and accidentally dropped a critical table, that is a failure due to lack of</blockquote>
<blockquote>structure. I said earlier that I prefer to talk about learning and</blockquote>
<blockquote>transparency rather than using the word structure, because really what we’re</blockquote>
<blockquote>talking about here is identifying the causes of failures, especially frequent</blockquote>
<blockquote>failures, and trying to figure out what we can change to solve for those</blockquote>
<blockquote>failures. This is fundamentally about learning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What is the lowest level at which people can sit forever, never getting</blockquote>
<blockquote>promoted but also not underperforming? This is your breakpoint level. For</blockquote>
<blockquote>many companies, it’s somewhere around senior engineer. Someone who’s made it</blockquote>
<blockquote>this far is a solid team member, but he may stay at this level indefinitely</blockquote>
<blockquote>by his own choice. It’s good to have a notion of where this is. You may even</blockquote>
<blockquote>want to use it as the point at which your ladder levels get harder to</blockquote>
<blockquote>achieve. Expect your team to cluster around this level, with fewer people</blockquote>
<blockquote>above or below it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Be clear about code review expectations. For the most part, code reviews</blockquote>
<blockquote>don’t catch bugs; tests catch bugs. The exceptions to this rule are that code</blockquote>
<blockquote>review can catch missing updates to comments or documentation or missing</blockquote>
<blockquote>changes to related features, and code reviewers can sometimes tell when there</blockquote>
<blockquote>is inadequate testing of the new or changed code. Code review is largely a</blockquote>
<blockquote>socialization exercise, so that multiple team members have seen and are aware</blockquote>
<blockquote>of the changed code.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Use a linter for style issues. Engineers can waste absurd amounts of time on</blockquote>
<blockquote>questions of style, specifically formatting. This should not be up for debate</blockquote>
<blockquote>in code review. Decide on a style, and put that style into a linter that</blockquote>
<blockquote>formats the code automatically. Allowing style to be up for discussion in</blockquote>
<blockquote>code review often leads to nitpicking and criticism that can feel</blockquote>
<blockquote>unproductive at best, and bullying at worst.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Resist the urge to point fingers and blame. It is incredibly tempting, after</blockquote>
<blockquote>a stressful outage, to point fingers and ask people why they failed to</blockquote>
<blockquote>foresee the consequences of their behavior. Why did they run that command on</blockquote>
<blockquote>that box? Why didn’t they test that? Why did they ignore that alert?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, this blaming only results in people being afraid to make</blockquote>
<blockquote>mistakes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Meditation isn’t a cure-all, but it can be a useful exercise to practice that</blockquote>
<blockquote>awareness of your own reactions, and for that reason I recommend trying it</blockquote>
<blockquote>for a while if you are interested. Some of my favorite resources include the</blockquote>
<blockquote>podcasts on tarabrach.com and the writings of Pema Chödrön.</blockquote>
