# Review


Here're some of the pertinent quotes I found from this book:


> The international evidence makes it clear that whether aggregate supply or
> demand effects dominate depends very much on the characteristics of the
> migrants and the labour markets they enter. For example, a former member of the
> Bank of England's Monetary Policy Comitte, David Blanchflower, argues that
> migration reduced British inflation pressures during the mid 2000s. He says
> aggregate supply effects dominated there during that period because the
> majority of migrants planned to return home within two years, so they saved
> most of their earnings and did not contribute much to demand. We conclude that,
> in New Zealand, the quality and diversity of migrants matters more than their
> raw numbers when it comes to overall economic impact.

> We see growing arrivals from Asia in the migration numbers, and we see even
> more pronounced changes in New Zealand's goods trade. Both reflect growing
> Asian economic influence, and in particular the economic rise of China. China
> is now NZ's largest trading partner for imports and exports of goods. It is
> also one of the top five sources of migrants for Australia, Canada, and the US
> as well as New Zealand, and the main source of foreign-born students in the US,
> UK, Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. (...) Along with the growth in
> trade with Asia, there has been a relative reduction in the importance of trade
> with other places, especially the US.

> Research into the impact of migration on the housing market has produced
> unusual results. One study for the Reserve Bank by Andrew Coleman and John
> Landon-Lane found that in the short term a net migration gain equal to 1 per
> cent of the population raised house prices by about 10 per cent at the national
> level. Later work for the Bank by Chris McDonald found a 1 per cent increase in
> the population caused an 8 per cent increase in house prices over the following
> three years, with increasing arrivals having more effect than reducing
> departures.

---

> British economic geographers Max Nathan and Neil Lee provide evidence from
> London that more diverse teams are more innovative.

---

> In a recent paper by Giovanni Peri and others say that STEM workers are the
> main drivers of productivity growth in the US, and that immigrant STEM workers
> in particular have had a significant positive impact on productiviy.
> Separately, Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle report that
> immigrant graduate students patent at double the rate of their American-born
> colleagues, reflecting the fact that immigrants disproportionately hold science
> and engineering degrees.

---

> In NZ, Stillman and Mare found that university-qualified migrants achieved wage
> and emplyment outcomes similar to those of locals more quickly than less
> skilled migrants did.

---

> In theory, competition for jobs from migrants could increase unemployment or
> reduce wages for existing workers. But the evidence is that any detrimental
> impacts on existing resident's employment or wages are small and short-term.
