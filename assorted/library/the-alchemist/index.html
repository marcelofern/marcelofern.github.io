<p>I grew up hearing the name “Paulo Coelho” very often but I never
associated this book with its author and neither did I have much
interest in figuring what kind of writer he is. To be completely honest,
I wasn’t a big reader (if a reader at all) during my time in the
motherland, so even though Paulo’s presence towers over many Brazilian
writers I somehow managed to never get attracted towards his works until
this current week.</p>
<p>While walking around a bookshop in Wellington just the week before, I
came across this book and thought it would be a good reading for my
partner since many people I know in Brazil had read this book. It would
be a good conversation starter for her, I thought.</p>
<p>Fast forward, I was the one who ended up reading it first. I wanted
to read fiction for a bit given that I had spent the past month (or
more) reading Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. A break from philosophy
and over-complicated vocabulary was needed. It ended up that the only
fiction book I had in front of me was The Alchemist. The only book in my
current list that I could read in my mother language (and there aren’t
many), and I had to travel all the way to New Zealand and get bored of a
German philosopher to finally end up reading it (in English).</p>
<p>Oh, and about the book… There isn’t much to say about it. Is it a
good read? Yes it is. The book flows swiftly, the scenes are easy to
imagine, the language is clear. The whole book can be read in a rainy
Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>I didn’t know anything about this book before reading it from the
source but my intuition knew that it was a book about self-help. The
mantra of “follow your dreams” is present at all times during the
reading, if not in the foreground it would be in the background through
the narrative and characters presentation. Santiago (the main character)
is a charismatic young boy. His naiveness and resilience are quite
relatable and they create a good atmosphere throughout the book.</p>
<p>In general, I think that the book was worth a read. Now I know what
people are referring to when they talk about Paulo Coelho and The
Alchemist. I am still not sure what exactly about this book made him
famous, but obviously something he did was right. My best guess is that
both the approachable reading and the relatable narrative might have
been the strongest points to trigger his fame.</p>
