<h1>Linux Rice</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What is a &quot;linux rice&quot;? When someone is &quot;ricing&quot; their unix system, they are
making functional and visual customisations to their desktop. Those could be
anything from changing the colour of a status bar to completely restructuring
their computer environment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<p>These are my main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong>: You can customise your applications and keyboard shortcuts to
satisfy your work-flow.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: You are in control of what gets installed on your application.
Strange background application no more.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: It is your system, you are not paying to use software that
deliberately spies on you.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Satisfaction</strong>: Whatever colour scheme you like.</li>
<li><strong>Because it is fun</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does it look like?</h2>

<h2>Softwares used</h2>
<h3>arch linux</h3>
<p>Arch is a DIY linux distribution. This means that arch gives the user a minimal
operational system (OS), delegating responsibility of packages installation to
the user. I.e, no batteries included. A good understanding of linux is
necessary to use this distro. Unless you are prepared to spend time learning
fundamentals and reading documentation. Some of the big perks of using arch
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling releases</li>
<li>Rich user repository (AUR)</li>
<li>The fantastic Arch wiki</li>
<li>No corporations behind it (community support only)</li>
<li>Amazingly helpful community</li>
</ul>
<h3>i3-gaps</h3>
<p>i3-gaps is a fork of the i3wm (tilling window manager) for X11. Instead of
having stacked windows that overlap (like in microsoft windows, or macOs),
windows are organized side-by-side as default, having gaps between them.
The benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Able to customise keyboard shortcuts to navigate through windows.</li>
<li>Easy to setup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>polybar</h3>
<p>Polybar is was the easiest and most user-friendly status bar I could find. With
a lot of pre-configured setups and out-of-the-box integrations, getting up to
speed is very simple.</p>
<h3>rofi</h3>
<p>A very simple and configurable application/script launcher.</p>
<h3>pywal</h3>
<p>For setting colours and themes.</p>
<h2>More about Ricing</h2>
<p>When it comes to finding inspiration for ricing in linux, a good place to look
at is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">/r/unixporn</a>. Most of my setup came
from picking apart different rices that users have shared in that channel. It
is also a good place to visit once in a while to stay up-to-date with what the
rest of the community is using.</p>
