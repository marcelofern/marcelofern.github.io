<h1>Managing Python Environments</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-08-06
</code></pre>
<p>The ecosystem for managing Python environments is huge, and so is the number
of tools that are used to manage these environments.</p>
<p>We have: <code>pyenv</code>, <code>virtualenv</code>, <code>virtualenvwrapper</code>, <code>asdf</code>, <code>conda</code>,
<code>anaconda</code>, <code>uv</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>pipenv</code> etc.</p>
<p>It is very easy to break your local environment if you are new to all of this.
This cartoon from xkcd sums it up well:</p>
<p><img src="python_xkcd.png" alt="python_xkcd"></p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240716100839/https://xkcd.com/1987/">source</a></p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to argue whether we need any of these tools when
working on multiple Python projects that potentially have incompatible Python
versions and dependencies.</p>
<p>Mind you that I program for work. Some of the knowledge and intentions behind
the way I do things have been learned through trial and error over time. What
is written here assumes that you either have a similar background or the
ability to understand or come to common ground on why some of those decisions
are harder to me than others.</p>
<p>Also, I expect that you don't need convincing that using your global Python
executable for everything is a bad idea, and that isolated virtual environments
for each project is the best solution to avoid dependency headaches.</p>
<h2>What Do These Tools Provide?</h2>
<p>Every tool I cited above is a little bit different, but I will pick <code>pyenv</code> as
an example since it is one of the tools with the smallest footprint.</p>
<p><code>pyenv</code> let's you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a new Python version: <code>pyenv install 3.10.4</code></li>
<li>Let pyenv automatically pick a Python environment when you <code>cd</code> into a
folder: <code>pyenv local &lt;version&gt;</code></li>
<li>A plugin framework that let's you add <code>virtualenv</code> among other tools.</li>
<li>Auto completion of commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>This all sounds pretty neat, but is it worth installing this tool made of
101,263 lines of code and data files (as per v2.4.9) just so that you have
these commands plus a plugin framework?</p>
<p>My answer is no. You are not going to need it and you are better off with
the default tools (more on that later).</p>
<p>There're three main points that I consider undesired behaviour coming from
the abstraction provided by <code>pyenv</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bash shims. A shim is merely a proxy. If you add the <code>pyenv</code> collection of
shims at the beginning of your $PATH variable, as in:<pre><code>$(pyenv root)/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`
</code></pre>
these shims will intercept Python commands like <code>pip</code> so that the correct
virtualised <code>pip</code> version for the directory you previously <code>cd</code> into is
chosen. Effectively, these shim commands replace your Python environment
commands like <code>pip</code> by the commands hardcoded by <code>pyenv</code> that do the magic
for you. But besides the magic nature of those shims, they can be very slow
(<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/2802">example</a>). If you have many
Python projects, these shims start to become a bit of a dark magic and you
won't have direct access to the Python tools if anything bad happens. Plus
if pyenv adds an order of magnitude of slowness as compared to running the
Python binary itself, pyenv becomes a painful tool to use.</li>
<li>Python versions are hidden from you, which is another magical feature that
makes it a little less ergonomic for you to control or debug a particular
environment yourself. This problem can be enhanced when the bug is in
<code>pyenv</code> itself. Checking for <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">recent
issues</a> in
the repository, one can see many distinct problems ranging from incompatible
changes within <code>pyenv</code> itself, to weird missing C++ links in the Python
executable, failing to create a virtual environment for a specific version
of Python, unavailable or unsupported Python binary, operating system
upgrades breaking the tool, etc. There are 1,700+ issues to date to pick
from.</li>
<li>So much bash. Assuming you are one of these people in the issues page that
need support, jumping into the source code isn't trivial. Almost half of the
repo is composed of bash scripts. That's about 50,000 lines of bash code
according to Github. I like bash for small scripts, specially for my own.
Debugging thousands of lines of someone else's bash is a much harder
problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading all that, you might still find that <code>pyenv</code> is actually useful
for you and the drawbacks aren't that meaningful. If that is the case, please
go for it! If <code>pyenv</code> wasn't useful it wouldn't be so popular. But developers
come in different flavours, and given past experience I can tell that <code>pyenv</code>
isn't for me.</p>
<p>I personally am not a big fan of magical tools and I like to have control and
understanding of how to fundamentally control my work environment as this is
an important part of my job. Any breakage in my local environment in the past
has caused me great pain and stress. Most of these problems have been caused
by mismanagement of dependencies; problems either created by me (lack of
knowledge of how underlying tools work), by the Operating System (ubuntu and
MacOS in particular), or by magic tools changing in backwards incompatible
ways.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have frequently been surprised by how easy it is to learn
and use basic tools available by the OS or the programming language itself,
which has only added to my scepticism of magical tools adding value in
exchange for their added cognitive load and potential bugs.</p>
<p>I also mentioned at the top of this section that <code>pyenv</code> is one of the tools
with the smallest footprint. That is true. Other tools such as <code>conda</code>, <code>asdf</code>
and, heck, <code>nix</code> are on a higher level of abstraction. To me, they are even
less desirable for the task of managing Python environments locally.</p>
<p>There are also other caveats with these tools such as the fact that they
change, grow bigger, and sometimes these changes create backwards
incompatibility with their own earlier versions as we saw above with <code>pyenv</code>.</p>
<p>It is not hard to find issues on those repositories where some conflicting
dependency has broken the dependency resolver tool itself
[<a href="https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/12325">1</a>]. If you are in a situation
where you need a version management tool to manage your version management
tool, things get complicated. It is a fact that software breaks, and if your
environment management that is build upon high levels of abstraction has failed
you, how will you fix this issue without knowing enough about this 100,000
lines code repository?</p>
<h2>So Why Do People Use These Tools?</h2>
<p>I can only speculate on empirical knowledge since I don't have any hard data I
can reach to, so take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I imagine that whether someone will choose to use an environment manager tool
comes down to their background. Preferring to pick a tool over another is a
choice compounded by many factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>How junior or senior a developer is. Being a junior developer generally
means that there are many pressing things to learn at once: The programming
language, the specific auxiliary technology ubiquitous in their areas, the
product of the business they are working for, text editors, frameworks,
developer hype, etc. It is totally understandable that when it comes to
understanding tools for managing an environment, spending time to analyse
all choices and select the best one is lower in their list of priorities.
They will pick the one that magically handles everything for them so that
they can move on. I have done that myself many times in many different
problem areas. Magic isn't by itself a bad thing, but I think that as one
progresses to more senior levels and becomes interested in particular
topics, it is important to materialise current knowledge and evolve it into
deep knowledge about how things work, and to make an effort to help the
community simplify things if all possible.</li>
<li>How much they care about their environment being deterministic at all times.
If a developer only works in a single codebase and the requirements don't
change often, why care about managing environments at all? This is a bit
of a moot point, but I know that developers who come from projects like this
have a hard time when they get a job at a company that has several codebases
with different tools and requirements for each and struggle to understand
or care about this type of problem.</li>
<li>Popularity of a given tool. There is trust that popular projects will be
stable enough and have a community of people backing it up. Trusting that
X tool is the tool that professionals in the field use to solve their
problems, so it must be good.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What do I do then?</h2>
<p>I am writing this article in 2024. Building Python from source is incredibly
easy yet surprisingly very few people actually do it. Yes... Building
from source! What a crazy idea, nobody builds from source these days and many
people don't know how to.</p>
<p>It is possible to download a specific Python version and set up a virtual
environment using Python's own
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240731142400/https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a>
tool without any extra dependency whatsoever.</p>
<p>Here's a short list of bash commands that download Python 3.11.5 and set a
virtual environment for it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># You'll be installing your Python binaries at $HOME/python_bin.
mkdir -p $HOME/.python_bin/ &amp;&amp; cd $HOME/.python_bin/

# Download the tar for the Python version you want.
curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/Python-3.11.5.tgz

# Decompress and install it.
tar -xzf Python-3.11.5.tgz &amp;&amp; cd Python-3.11.5
./configure --prefix=/tmp/localpython/3.11.5 &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

# Create your environment anywhere you like.
./$HOME/python_bin/Python-3.11.5/python -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>That is it. Now you know how the whole process works (it is so easy) and you're
using <code>venv</code> which was introduced to core Python in 3.3+. You can also play
with compilation flags and build the binary with some extensions (but you don't
have to!).</p>
<p>Of course this is still using some tools that abstract the burden of building
the binary for the project. If you have never built a big C project like
CPython before, you might be asking yourself what is this <code>./configure</code> script,
what is <code>make</code> and so on so forth. In a nutshell, this is how binaries are
usually packaged - at some level either you are doing this or your operating
system has come up with a standardised way to build from source for you via
a package manager.</p>
<p>So now you can run however many virtual environments you want from that binary,
and put them anywhere you like. If you want extra convenience to activate that
environment for a particular project, just create an alias:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">alias myproj=&quot;/somewhere/my_env/bin/activate &amp;&amp; cd /somewhere/myproj&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you aren't using Python 3.3+, just swap <code>venv</code> for anything else that works
for your version, or heck, just directly use that Python executable for your
project - it is totally disposable and you can download another one any time
you like. Now that you know how the process works, it is very easy to change it
to your taste, and that's exactly what I wanted to show in this post.</p>
<p>If you want some further ideas, this is the script I am using on my <code>bashrc</code>
file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">install_python_version() {
  # call this function with a version of Python
  # like `install_python_version 3.11.9`.

  # Clean up first
  rm -rf /tmp/python-install

  # This is where the different Python executables will be installed.
  DIR=$HOME/.python_bin/python-$1
  mkdir -p $DIR

  # This is where temporary installation files will be available.
  mkdir -p /tmp/python-install &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/python-install

  # Download the python version
  curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/$1/Python-$1.tgz

  tar -xzf Python-$1.tgz &amp;&amp; cd /tmp/python-install/Python-$1
  ./configure --prefix=$DIR &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

  echo &quot;Now you can install your virtualenv:&quot;
  echo &quot;$HOME/.python_bin/python-$1/bin/python3 -m venv /tmp/my_env&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can invoke it from the shell with <code>install_python_version 3.11.5</code>.</p>
<h2>But If Building From Source Was Good Package Managers Wouldn't Exist...</h2>
<p>While this is generally true, and package managers are incredibly useful tools,
I think that it is worth picking a battle now and then and building something
from source when it makes sense to do so. I think that at a minimum, being
comfortable building your <strong>main</strong> tools plus other tools that are notorious
for having conflicting versions from source is a good general advice.</p>
<p>In my case, I rely on my OS package manager a lot for my secondary tools. But
even though pacman is a great package manager, it is not without its drawbacks.
It only builds dependencies with the default flags. If I need more
customisation, I have to step out of the manager or understand how the manager
works so that I can apply the particular building flags I want.</p>
<p>This is also a problem in a rolling release system like Arch Linux, as
installing multiple versions of the same dependency will point you towards some
form of virtualisation (using docker, for example) or building from source.</p>
