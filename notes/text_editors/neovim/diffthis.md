# diffthis

It can be useful to see the `diff` output of two different files in neovim.

Use `diffthis` to display the `diff` for two different files split horizontally
or vertically

1. Open one of the files and run `:diffthis`.
2. Open another file in a split window and run `:diffthis`.
3. Analyse the diff and then run `:diffoff` when you're ready.
