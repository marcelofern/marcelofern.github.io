# Music Theory Book Review

This is a very easy to follow book, even for those who don't know any music
theory.

I came to this book knowing a little bit about music theory. I already know how
to read music, the basic scales (major, minor, blues), but I was still
surprised by how many gaps I had in basic things.

Each chapter is short and builds on the back of previous chapters. All the
important concepts behind music are present here. It doesn't give you any
depth, but at least you can use this book as a reference if you ever forget
little bits and bops of music theory.
