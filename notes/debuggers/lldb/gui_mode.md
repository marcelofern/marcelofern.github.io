# GUI Mode

Useful for showing more of the code around instead of using `l`, `l -`, and
`f`. But the terminal is still better.

## Opening GUI mode

```sh
(lldb) gui
```

## Shutting GUI mode

The gui can be closed by pressing `ESC` (it might take half a sec).

## Getting help during GUI mode

Simply press `h` and use arros to navigate.
