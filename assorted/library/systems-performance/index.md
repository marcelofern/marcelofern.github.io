**In progress** - I will annotate this more as a go through the book.

This review is based on someone that already has experience with Linux and has
done performance analysis of programs before. Take this into consideration when
reading the below. If you are on the same boat, this review might help you as
guided reading.

## First chapters

Chapter 1 is very introductory. If you have ~5 years of experience or
more, chances are you are familiar with a lot of the content and you can skip
the chapter in its entirety. However, check the "Linux Perf Analysis in 60
Seconds" section, it's worth it.

Chapter 2 is still very basic. I'd recommend reading the Concepts and
Methodologies section, and skimming through the Modelling section so that you
are familiar to the concepts as they are used in further chapters. The
explanations are not super thorough, so you might want to do background
research when you feel like you need more information in future chapters, but
do not stop here.

Chapter 3 is a basic introduction to Operating Systems. It is still very
surface level. It may provide more questions than answers, and it goes very
fast. Have a look at the "Background" section for terms you are not familiar
with and read them, but skip the others. Read the "Linux" section, skip the
rest.
