# Thoughts On Management

I have been managing people for the past 3 years at my current job. This is
not extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager at best.

However, I have put some thought on lessons that I have learnt on my way and
reoccurring patterns that have made my job easier (or more difficult in certain
cases), and I think that some of these tips would've helped greatly at the
beginning.

The overall management style I have been applying, and that has also been
successfully applied **to me** by some of my managers, can be summarised in 5
**must's**.

1. You must facilitate.
2. You must listen.
3. You must take an active interest in the development of your employees.
4. You must reassure.
5. You must keep an open mind about your management skills.

Having the "personality of it" or some innate charisma would be of great help,
but it is not strictly necessary as long as you are open to work on it.

## You Must Facilitate

Being promoted as a manager after performing well as a software developer is a
regular occurrence of our times. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to become a bad manager.

The Venn intersection between skills required to be a developer and be a
manager is a narrow one.

My first challenge stepping into the role for the first time was to manage my
own conflicts of interest. I wanted to continue develop my knack for coding as
I deemed my individual contributor skills more important than management and
leadership skills. That meant that I wasn't facilitating much and the lack of
leadership and direction was tampering the development of my team.

Once my team grew to about ~7 developers I realised that what I was doing was
unsustainable. I wasn't having enough time to spend on quality coding and R&D,
because I was spending time on management duties, and I was also not helping
unblock my team's work as I was spending too much time coding. My stress levels
raised and I had to step back and re-approach the problem.

## You Must Reassure

## You must keep an open mind about your management skills.

Having the "personality of it" or innate charisma would be of great help on
performing management duty, but it is not strictly necessary as long as you are
open to work on it.
