# Moqueca (vibed)

- Plantain or cassava (these are the main chunky bits - as many as you like)
- Several capsicum and tomatoes They provide the taste of the moqueca "curry"
- Sweet paprika
- Coconut cream
- Canned tomato diced
- Stock powder
- White pepper
- Optional veggies (potatoes can go well)

## Tips

- Start by frying the plantain (or cassava). Move it out of the pan when it's
  done (to avoid damaging their texture).
- Then move the capsicums and fresh tomatoes in.
- Put all the spices and leave it to cook for a bit before adding coconut
  cream.
- The rest is easy. Put whatever else veggies or protein sources you want.

Also:

- Quantities are arbitrary and haven't been noted above. Just make sure to make
  the consistency of the moqueca-gravy relatively creamy.

- Make the quantity of capsicum N+1 where N is the number of people you are
  serving. For example, if you are serving for 2, use 3 capsicums (small are
  fine).
