# Review: The Redemption Of Time

This is a "fan book" written by Baoshu to finish up the trilogy of Remembrance
of Earth's Past (REP).

I thought it was a pleasant and creative read. It answers all of the gaps left
out by the ending of REP. I think that the author did a good job at keeping the
spirit of the original story, while finding a satisfactory conclusion for this
crazy space opera.

My biggest silly curiosity was to learn more about the Solarian society. How
they looked liked and organised. This books gave me an answer to those, so I'm
happy.
