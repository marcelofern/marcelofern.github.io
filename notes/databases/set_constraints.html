<p>SET CONSTRAINTS â€” set constraint check timing for the current transaction</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240127151138/https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-set-constraints.html">Source</a></p>
<h2>What it does</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>SET CONSTRAINTS sets the behavior of constraint checking within the current
transaction. IMMEDIATE constraints are checked at the end of each statement.
DEFERRED constraints are not checked until transaction commit. Each
constraint has its own IMMEDIATE or DEFERRED mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon creation, a constraint is given one of three characteristics: DEFERRABLE
INITIALLY DEFERRED, DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, or NOT DEFERRABLE. The
third class is always IMMEDIATE and is not affected by the SET CONSTRAINTS
command. The first two classes start every transaction in the indicated mode,
but their behavior can be changed within a transaction by SET CONSTRAINTS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Surprise!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When SET CONSTRAINTS changes the mode of a constraint from DEFERRED to
IMMEDIATE, the new mode takes effect retroactively: any outstanding data
modifications that would have been checked at the end of the transaction are
instead checked during the execution of the SET CONSTRAINTS command. If any
such constraint is violated, the SET CONSTRAINTS fails (and does not change
the constraint mode). Thus, SET CONSTRAINTS can be used to force checking of
constraints to occur at a specific point in a transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>But...</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently, only UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, REFERENCES (foreign key), and EXCLUDE
constraints are affected by this setting. NOT NULL and CHECK constraints are
always checked immediately when a row is inserted or modified (not at the end
of the statement). Uniqueness and exclusion constraints that have not been
declared DEFERRABLE are also checked immediately.</p>
