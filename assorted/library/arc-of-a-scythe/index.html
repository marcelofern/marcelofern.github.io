<h2>Review</h2>
<p>One of the things I liked the most about the books was the build ups. Many
times there were multiple narratives happening at the same time, keeping me
hooked up. It usually followed that I'd be a bit disappointed when the
narrative switched to another theme (a good kind of disappointment though),
only to quickly get exciting again.</p>
<p>I think the story is clever and creative. There were a few deus-ex-machina
moments happening (maybe too many), but the only one that really bothered me
was when Rowan, about to be burned in a pile of fire, was suddenly released by
the scythes of the lonely star on the third book. That was a bit of a push, and
Goddard's death was a bit meh. Too sudden. I think that some development about
his early life in Mars with Xenocrates as an apprentice would've been great.</p>
<p>Faraday is also a great character that didn't get much attention after the
first book. It would've been nice to have an encounter between him and Marie to
explore their relationship (Marie is also a great character).</p>
<p>The books were an easy read, which was much welcomed for me at the time. I'll
say this one is a 7/10 :-)</p>
