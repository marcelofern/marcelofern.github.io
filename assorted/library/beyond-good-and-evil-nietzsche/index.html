<blockquote>
<p>“A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought not to be
and that the world as it ought to do not exist. According to this view,
our existence (action, suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: this
‘in vain’ is the nihilists’ pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the
nihilists.” - Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="on-the-author">On the author</h2>
<p>Nietzsche has a reputation for being a depressive nihilist. This does
not seem to translate into what I’ve grasped from his ideas in this
book. This general thinking comes about from the fact that he suffered
from ill for most of his life (sick child, war-induced body damages,
diseased adult life), and because of that, it seems tempting to create a
connection between his painful life and his ‘way too’ critical
philosophy, therefore labelling it pessimist and/or nihilist. However,
this seems to be a much flawed statement, given that he criticised the
nihilist point of view several times - as in the excerpt above - and he
also, for many times, argued against Schopenhauer’s pessimism.</p>
<p>Some critics will elaborate more about the wrong reputation
attributed to Nietzsche, but one thing that stood out to my attention
after reading some reviews, is the common statement that just like
Machiavelli is misinterpreted, so is Nietzsche in the sense that their
observations of the way nature and society come to be, are mistaken for
recommendations of how nature and society should be.</p>
<h2 id="on-reading-this-book">On reading this book</h2>
<p>This book - and translation - is very impenetrable. The text is
written in a form of dramatic conversation. Nietzsche’s ideas go far and
then come back again after an exhaustive description and subsequent
changes of context that don’t necessary add much to the central topics,
but on the contrary, often come as a bag of words.</p>
<p>Many people on the internet say that you’ve got to think like
Nietzsche (I’d rather not, actually), without explaining what “thinking
like Nietzsche” entitles. But enough of this; some people will be more
prepared to read this book if they are keen to embrace all the different
nuances hidden in the text, or if they simply, like Nietzsche, have high
appreciation for the art of writing and will therefore enjoy the style
of the text in addition to the idea transmitted in it.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-content">On the content</h2>
<p>Some claims in this book are very ridiculous to start with. The
opening phrase in the book is:“Supposing truth to be a woman…” this sets
the tone of what I meant by ‘ridiculous’. It might catch you out of
guard, but the book does not go on sexualising philosophy, but it does
bring very misogynist ideas instead.</p>
<p>On another subject, the explanation of (or the lack thereof),
master-slave morality did nothing to convince me of his ideas and takes
on morality. The rants against democracy and socialism also did not make
me buy the idea of ‘herd mentality’ altogether, even though I do agree
with those respects in a marginal level and was somehow prepared to
accept it if presented by a sound argument. On top of that, the
criticism against Christianity isn’t spectacularly novel (even at those
times), and also one-sided. I do understand the feeling of ‘revenge’
against the establishment (Christendom) that many philosophers had back
then (and still have today), for burning books with the most valuable
knowledge after being categorised as heresies. However, I do not think
that there were sound arguments against much of the Christendom regime
in this book, and I do not get why Nietzsche is considers by much as an
iconic atheist.</p>
<p>On the bright side, some of his maxims were interestingly valuable:
“Who has not for the sake of his reputation sacrificed himself?” and the
book also presented interesting critiques against Stoicism that I never
thought or heard of, and other critiques around old philosophers being
dogmatic were also interesting. It is worth nothing, though, that many
arguments used to get to those critiques are obscure and boring, and
overall life is too short for obscurantism.</p>
