<h1>Review: Pedagogy Of The Oppressed</h0>
<pre><code class="language-">
Created at: 2024-09-12
</code></pre><p>Paulo Freire is a Brazilian pedagogue who was born and raised in a impoverished area in Brazil's north east in the 1920's.</p>
<p>His father was a policeman, and his mother a home-stay mom. After his father's death, when Paulo was only 9 years old, he became even more impoverished but somehow managed to study and get a degree on Law, which he never used as his passion was on teaching - not law, but the alphabet.</p>
<p>Whether you like Paulo Freire or not, his story is one of fantastic achievements built on suffering, estate persecution, and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In Brazil, Paulo is either acclaimed or criticised. He's seen as either a pedagogy revolutionary and intellectual, or a Marxist with corrupted intentions.</p>
<p>Most of the people who criticise him, though, haven't read his books. I have made this mistake in the past.</p>
<p>This is not an apology for Paulo either, as I don't fully agree with his ideas either, and think that many of his takes are only idealistic. However, I came to appreciate his work now that I have read it. Paulo definitely knows how to put the revolutionary spirit into words and agree you or not with his ideas, the work he's done is remarkable.</p>
<p>Here are some of my highlights:</p>
<h2>Highlights</h0>
<blockquote>Because it is a distortion of being more fully human, sooner or later being</blockquote>
<blockquote>less human leads the oppressed to struggle against those who made them so. In</blockquote>
<blockquote>order for this struggle to have meaning, the oppressed must not, in seeking</blockquote>
<blockquote>to regain their humanity (which is a way to create it), become in turn</blockquote>
<blockquote>oppressors of the oppressors, but rather restorers of the humanity of both.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Who are better prepared than the oppressed to understand the terrible</blockquote>
<blockquote>significance of an oppressive society?</blockquote>
<blockquote>But almost always, during the initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed,</blockquote>
<blockquote>instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to be-come oppressors, or</blockquote>
<blockquote>“sub-oppressors.” The very structure of their thought has been conditioned by</blockquote>
<blockquote>the contradictions of the concrete, existential situation by which they were</blockquote>
<blockquote>shaped. Their ideal is to be men; but for them, to be men is to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>oppressors. This is their model of humanity. This phenomenon derives from the</blockquote>
<blockquote>fact that the oppressed, at a certain moment of their existential experience,</blockquote>
<blockquote>adopt an attitude of “adhesion” to the oppressor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the basic elements of the relationship between oppressor and oppressed</blockquote>
<blockquote>is prescription. Every prescription represents the imposition of one</blockquote>
<blockquote>individual’s choice upon another, transforming the consciousness of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>person prescribed to into one that conforms with the pre-scriber’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>consciousness. Thus, the behavior of the oppressed is a prescribed behavior,</blockquote>
<blockquote>following as it does the guidelines of the op-pressor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>the situation of oppression is a dehumanized and dehumanizing totality</blockquote>
<blockquote>affecting both the oppressors and those whom they oppress, it is the latter</blockquote>
<blockquote>who must, from their stifled humanity, wage for both the struggle for a</blockquote>
<blockquote>fuller humanity; the oppressor, who is himself dehumanized because he</blockquote>
<blockquote>dehumanizes others, is unable to lead this struggle.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Resolution of the oppressor-oppressed contradiction indeed implies the</blockquote>
<blockquote>disappearance of the oppressors as a dominant class. However, the restraints</blockquote>
<blockquote>imposed by the former oppressed on their oppressors, so that the latter</blockquote>
<blockquote>cannot reassume their former position, do not constitute oppression.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But even when the contradiction is resolved authentically by a new situation</blockquote>
<blockquote>established by the liberated laborers, the former op-pressors do not feel</blockquote>
<blockquote>liberated. On the contrary, they genuinely consider themselves to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>oppressed. Conditioned by the experience of oppressing others, any situation</blockquote>
<blockquote>other than their former seems to them like oppression. Formerly, they could</blockquote>
<blockquote>eat, dress, wear shoes, be educated, travel, and hear Beethoven; while</blockquote>
<blockquote>millions did not eat, had no clothes or shoes, neither studied nor traveled,</blockquote>
<blockquote>much less listened to Beethoven. Any restriction on this way of life, in the</blockquote>
<blockquote>name of the rights of the community, appears to the former oppressors as a</blockquote>
<blockquote>profound violation of their individual rights</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the other hand, at a certain point in their existential experience the</blockquote>
<blockquote>oppressed feel an irresistible attraction towards the oppressors and their</blockquote>
<blockquote>way of life. Sharing this way of life becomes an overpowering aspiration. In</blockquote>
<blockquote>their alienation, the oppressed want at any cost to resemble the oppressors,</blockquote>
<blockquote>to imitate them, to follow them. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in</blockquote>
<blockquote>the middle-class op-pressed, who yearn to be equal to the “eminent” men and</blockquote>
<blockquote>women of the upper class.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A careful analysis of the teacher-student relationship at any level, inside</blockquote>
<blockquote>or outside the school, reveals its fundamen-tally narrative character. This</blockquote>
<blockquote>relationship involves a nar-rating Subject (the teacher) and patient,</blockquote>
<blockquote>listening objects (the students). The contents, whether values or empirical</blockquote>
<blockquote>dimensions of reality, tend in the process of being narrated to become</blockquote>
<blockquote>lifeless and petrified. Education is suffering from narration sickness.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Narration (with the teacher as narrator) leads the students to memorize</blockquote>
<blockquote>mechanically the narrated content. Worse yet, it turns them into</blockquote>
<blockquote>“containers,” into “receptacles” to be “filled” by the teacher. The more</blockquote>
<blockquote>completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more</blockquote>
<blockquote>meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students</blockquote>
<blockquote>they are.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Populist manifestations perhaps best exemplify this type of behavior by the</blockquote>
<blockquote>oppressed, who, by identifying with charismatic leaders, come to feel that</blockquote>
<blockquote>they themselves are active and effective. The rebellion they express as they</blockquote>
<blockquote>emerge in the historical process is motivated by that desire to act</blockquote>
<blockquote>effectively. The dominant elites consider the remedy to be more domination</blockquote>
<blockquote>and repression, carried out in the name of freedom, order, and social peace</blockquote>
<blockquote>(that is, the peace of the elites). Thus they can condemn—logically, from</blockquote>
<blockquote>their point of view—“the violence of a strike by workers and [can] call upon</blockquote>
<blockquote>the state in the same breath to use violence in putting down the strike.”7</blockquote>
<blockquote>Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher</blockquote>
<blockquote>cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with</blockquote>
<blockquote>students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but</blockquote>
<blockquote>one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while</blockquote>
<blockquote>being taught also teach. They be-come jointly responsible for a process in</blockquote>
<blockquote>which all grow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We must never merely discourse on the present situation, must never provide</blockquote>
<blockquote>the people with programs which have little or nothing to do with their own</blockquote>
<blockquote>preoccupations, doubts, hopes, and fears—programs which at times in fact</blockquote>
<blockquote>increase the fears of the oppressed consciousness. It is not our role to</blockquote>
<blockquote>speak to the people about our own view of the world, nor to attempt to impose</blockquote>
<blockquote>that view on them, but rather to dialogue with the people about their view</blockquote>
<blockquote>and ours</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dialogue with the people is radically necessary to every authentic</blockquote>
<blockquote>revolution. This is what makes it a revolution, as distinguished from a</blockquote>
<blockquote>military coup. One does not expect dialogue from a coup—only deceit (in order</blockquote>
<blockquote>to achieve “legitimacy”) or force (in order to repress).</blockquote>
<blockquote>On the other hand, it would be a false premise to believe that activism</blockquote>
<blockquote>(which is not true action) is the road to revolution. People will be truly</blockquote>
<blockquote>critical if they live the plenitude of the praxis, that is, if their action</blockquote>
<blockquote>encompasses a critical reflection which increasingly organizes their thinking</blockquote>
<blockquote>and thus leads them to move from a purely naïve knowledge of reality to a</blockquote>
<blockquote>higher level, one which enables them to perceive the causes of reality.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A Mr. Giddy, later President of the Royal Society, raised objections which</blockquote>
<blockquote>could be matched in every country: “However specious in theory the project</blockquote>
<blockquote>might be of giving education to the laboring classes of the poor, it would be</blockquote>
<blockquote>prejudicial to their morals and happiness; it would teach them to despise</blockquote>
<blockquote>their lot in life instead of making them good servants in agricultural and</blockquote>
<blockquote>other laborious employments; instead of teaching them subordination it would</blockquote>
<blockquote>render them fractious and refractory as was evident in the manufacturing</blockquote>
<blockquote>counties; it would enable them to read seditious pamphlets, vicious books and</blockquote>
<blockquote>publications against Christianity; it would render them insolent to their</blockquote>
<blockquote>superiors and in a few years the legislature would find it necessary to</blockquote>
<blockquote>direct the strong arm of power against them.8 What Mr. Giddy really wanted</blockquote>
<blockquote>(and what the elites of today want, although they do not denounce popular</blockquote>
<blockquote>education so cynically and openly) was for the people not to think. Since the</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mr. Giddys of all epochs, as an oppressor class, cannot think with the</blockquote>
<blockquote>people, neither can they let the people think for themselves. </blockquote>
<blockquote>The first characteristic of antidialogical action is the necessity for</blockquote>
<blockquote>conquest. The antidialogical individual, in his relations with others, aims</blockquote>
<blockquote>at conquering them—increasingly and by every means, from the toughest to the</blockquote>
<blockquote>most refined, from the most repressive to the most solicitous (paternalism).</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is necessary for the oppressors to approach the people in order, via</blockquote>
<blockquote>subjugation, to keep them passive. This approximation, however, does not</blockquote>
<blockquote>involve being with the people, or require true communication. It is</blockquote>
<blockquote>accomplished by the oppressors’ depositing myths indispensable to the</blockquote>
<blockquote>preservation of the status quo: for example, the myth that the oppressive</blockquote>
<blockquote>order is a “free society”; the myth that all persons are free to work where</blockquote>
<blockquote>they wish, that if they don’t like their boss they can leave him and look for</blockquote>
<blockquote>another job; the myth that this order respects human rights and is therefore</blockquote>
<blockquote>worthy of esteem; the myth that anyone who is industrious can become an</blockquote>
<blockquote>entrepreneur—worse yet, the myth that the street vendor is as much an</blockquote>
<blockquote>entrepreneur as the owner of a large factory; the myth of the universal right</blockquote>
<blockquote>of education, when of all the Brazilian children who enter primary schools</blockquote>
<blockquote>only a tiny fraction ever reach the university; the myth of the equality of</blockquote>
<blockquote>all individuals, when the question: “Do you know who you’re talking to?” is</blockquote>
<blockquote>still current among us; the myth of the heroism of the oppressor classes as</blockquote>
<blockquote>defenders of “Western Christian civilization” against “materialist</blockquote>
<blockquote>barbarism”; the myth of the charity and generosity of the elites, when what</blockquote>
<blockquote>they really do as a class is to foster selective “good deeds” (subsequently</blockquote>
<blockquote>elaborated into the myth of “disinterested aid,” which on the international</blockquote>
<blockquote>level was severely criticized by Pope John XXIII);14 the myth that the</blockquote>
<blockquote>dominant elites, “recognizing their duties,” promote the advancement of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>people, so that t he people, in a gesture of gratitude, should accept the</blockquote>
<blockquote>words of the elites and be conformed to them; the myth that rebellion is a</blockquote>
<blockquote>sin against God; the myth of private property as fundamental to personal</blockquote>
<blockquote>human development (so long as oppressors are the only true human beings); the</blockquote>
<blockquote>myth of the industriousness of the oppressors and the laziness and dishonesty</blockquote>
<blockquote>of the oppressed, as well as the myth of the natural inferiority of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>latter and the superiority of the former.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As the oppressor minority subordinates and dominates the majority, it must</blockquote>
<blockquote>divide it and keep it divided in order to remain in power. The minority</blockquote>
<blockquote>cannot permit itself the luxury of tolerating the unification of the people,</blockquote>
<blockquote>which would undoubtedly signify a serious threat to their own hegemony.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Accordingly, the oppressors halt by any method (including violence) any</blockquote>
<blockquote>action which in even incipient fashion could awaken the op-pressed to the</blockquote>
<blockquote>need for unity. Concepts such as unity, organization, and struggle are</blockquote>
<blockquote>immediately labeled as dangerous. In fact, of course, these concepts are</blockquote>
<blockquote>dangerous—to the oppressors—for their realization is necessary to actions of</blockquote>
<blockquote>liberation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The same divisive effect occurs in connection with the so-called “leadership</blockquote>
<blockquote>training courses,” which are (although carried out without any such intention</blockquote>
<blockquote>by many of their organizers) in the last analysis alienating. These courses</blockquote>
<blockquote>are based on the naïve assumption that one can promote the community by</blockquote>
<blockquote>training its leaders—as if it were the parts that promote the whole and not</blockquote>
<blockquote>the whole which, in being promoted, promotes the parts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For cultural invasion to succeed, it is essential that those invaded become</blockquote>
<blockquote>convinced of their intrinsic inferiority. Since everything has its opposite,</blockquote>
<blockquote>if those who are invaded consider themselves inferior, they must necessarily</blockquote>
<blockquote>recognize the superiority of the invaders. The values of the latter thereby</blockquote>
<blockquote>become the pattern for the former. The more invasion is accentuated and those</blockquote>
<blockquote>invaded are alienated from the spirit of their own culture and from</blockquote>
<blockquote>themselves, the more the latter want to be like the invaders: to walk like</blockquote>
<blockquote>them, dress like them, talk like them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The parent-child relationship in the home usually reflects the objective</blockquote>
<blockquote>cultural conditions of the surrounding social structure. If the conditions</blockquote>
<blockquote>which penetrate the home are authoritarian, rigid, and dominating, the home</blockquote>
<blockquote>will increase the climate of oppression.30 As these authoritarian relations</blockquote>
<blockquote>between parents and children intensify, children in their infancy</blockquote>
<blockquote>increasingly internalize the paternal authority.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A group in a New York ghetto was presented a coded situation showing a big</blockquote>
<blockquote>pile of garbage on a street corner—the very same street where the group was</blockquote>
<blockquote>meeting. One of the participants said at once, “I see a street in Africa or</blockquote>
<blockquote>Latin America.” “And why not in New York?” asked the teacher. “Because we are</blockquote>
<blockquote>the United States and that can’t happen here.” Beyond a doubt this man and</blockquote>
<blockquote>some of his comrades who agreed with him were retreating from a reality so</blockquote>
<blockquote>offensive to them that even to acknowledge that reality was threatening. For</blockquote>
<blockquote>an alienated person, conditioned by a culture of achievement and personal</blockquote>
<blockquote>success, to recognize his situation as objectively unfavorable seems to</blockquote>
<blockquote>hinder his own possibilities of success.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is essential not to confuse modernization with development. The former,</blockquote>
<blockquote>although it may affect certain groups in the “satellite society,” is almost</blockquote>
<blockquote>always induced; and it is the metropolitan society which derives the true</blockquote>
<blockquote>benefits therefrom. A society which is merely modernized without developing</blockquote>
<blockquote>will continue—even if it takes over some minimal delegated powers of</blockquote>
<blockquote>decision—to depend on the outside country. This is the fate of any dependent</blockquote>
<blockquote>society, as long as it remains dependent.</blockquote>
