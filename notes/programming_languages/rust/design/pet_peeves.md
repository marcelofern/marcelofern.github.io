# Pet Peeves

1. Rust uses rust to compile itself. This means I need some version of rust
   installed locally. I like to build from source, but that means I have to add
   a Rust bin dependency before moving ahead. When compiling rust locally, I
   ended up with a 6GB build directory.

2. When printing the assembly code generated by Rust with `--emit=asm`
   the functions get a pretty strange name. For example, a function
   called `my_sweet_fun` ended up being renamed to
   `_ZN3prj12my_sweet_fun17h48a8fcf5733b3ef9E`. This makes inspecting the
   assembly files less convenient.
