<h1>Day 4</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2025-01-15
</code></pre>
<p>Today I'm finally starting chapter 1!</p>
<p>I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, but I've finished that a while ago
and am probably rusty. No bad in getting a refresher.</p>
<h2>Interesting Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A mid-century computer (the IBM 650) cost $300,000, weighed 2.7 tons, and
contained 126 lamps on its control panel; in an amusing reversal, a
contemporary energy-efficient lamp contains a computer of greater capability
within its (physical) base, and costs about $10.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is often the case that the panel controls and cabinet hardware of an
instrument cost more than the electronics inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Voltage</h2>
<p><strong>Intuitive Explanation</strong>: What you apply to a circuit to make currents flow.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Definition</strong>: The voltage between two points is the cost in energy
(work) to move positive charge from a more negative point (lower potential) to
a more positive point (higher potential). Equivalently, the energy released
when a unit charge moves &quot;downhill&quot; from the higher potential to the lower.</p>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong>: Often denoted by <em>V</em>, sometimes by <em>E</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nicknames</strong>: Potential Difference or Electromotive Force.</p>
<p><strong>Unit of Measure</strong>: Volt (V)</p>
<h2>Current</h2>
<p><strong>Symbol</strong>: <em>I</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The rate of flow of electric charge past a point.</p>
<p><strong>Unit of Measure</strong>: Ampere (or amp).</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: A current of 1 amp equals a flow of 1 coulomb (6*10^18 electrons)
of charge per second.</p>
<p><strong>Conventions</strong>: In a circuit, current flows from a more positive point to a
more negative one, even though the actual electron flow is in the opposite
direction!</p>
<h2>Important Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Kirchhoff's current law (KCL): The sum of currents into a point in a circuit
equals the sum of the currents out. Such a point is often referred to as a
node.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL): Parallel connections have the same voltage
across them. This also means that the sum of the voltage drops around any
closed circuit is zero.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The power (energy per unit time) consumed by a circuit device is:
<code>P = VI</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>P is in watts.</li>
<li>A 55W bulb connected at 220V plug has 0.25 amps through it.</li>
<li>When dealing with periodic signals, P=VI deal with <em>average power</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ohm's law: <code>R = V/I</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Resistors</h2>
<pre><code>R(series) = R1 + R2

R(parallel) = (R1*R2) / (R1 + R2)

Alternatively...

R(parallel) = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2)
</code></pre>
<p>Tip: By parallelising resistors you <strong>always get a smaller resistance</strong>.</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Usually made of some conducting stuff (carbon, thin metal, carbon film, wire of
poor conductivity...) and characterised by its resistance:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most frequent resistors come in values from 1Ω to 10MΩ.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also characterised by how much power they can <em>safely</em> dissipate. Usually
around 1/4W or 1/8W</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1 You have a 5k resistor and a 10k resistor. What is their combined
resistance (a) in series and (b) in parallel?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(a): 15k
(b): 50k/15k = 3.333k</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.2 If you place a 1 ohm resistor across a 12 volt car battery, how much power
will it dissipate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P = VI
V = 12V
I = V/R = 12A
P = 144W</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.3 Prove the formulas for series and parallel resistors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL): Parallel connections have the same voltage
across them. This also means that the sum of the voltage drops around any
closed circuit is zero.</li>
<li>Kirchhoff's current law (KCL): The sum of currents into a point in a circuit
equals the sum of the currents out. Such a point is often referred to as a
node.</li>
<li>Ohm's law: <code>R = V/I</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine a circuit that has one voltage source and two resistors, all connected
in series. Where:</p>
<pre><code>- V1         = voltage across R1.
- V2         = voltage across R2.
- I1         = current across R1.
- I2         = current across R2.
- V          = power supply.
- R(series)  = resulting resistance of the circuit in series.
- I          = corrent through power supply.
</code></pre>
<p>From 1., <code>V = V1 + V2</code>
From 2., <code>I1 = I2 = V</code>
From 3., <code>R(series) = V/I</code></p>
<p>From ohm's law:</p>
<pre><code>V1 = R1 * I1 = R1 * I
V2 = R2 * I2 = R2 * I

V = R1 * I + R2 * I
R(series) = V/I = (R1 * I + R2 * I)/I

Therefore
R(series) = R1 + R2
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the parallel case let's imagine that V, R1, and R2 are connected in
parallel.</p>
<p>From 1., <code>V = V1 = V2</code>
From 2., <code>I = I1 + I2</code>
From 3., <code>R(parallel) = V/I</code></p>
<pre><code>I1 = V1/R1 = V/R1
I2 = V2/R2 = V/R2

R(parallel) = V/I = V/(V/R1 + V/R2)

Therefore
R(parallel) = 1/(R1 + R2)
