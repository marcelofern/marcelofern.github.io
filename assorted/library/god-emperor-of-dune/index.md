# Review

This has been the best book in the Dune series yet. Leto II becomes the
absolute protagonist and his personality development throughout the book is
quite entertaining.

The one thing I disliked about the book, and this is probably a problem
throughout the series, is Duncan Idaho. It just feels forced to bring Duncan
back over and over. He does not have many interesting traits (in my opinion),
other than being the loyal soldier of house Atreides. In many cases, he appears
irrational and impatient. This is quite disappointing for me as the character
could be used in a different way. Perhaps more mature and less impulsive.

Other than that, the plot is very creative and took me by surprise in many
cases. I sort of wanted to see the development of Leto II and Hwi's
relationship. I'm hoping to see a little bit of that on the next book. Another
thing I missed in this book was a better explanation and description of the
Golden Path. Specially, how the alternative (human extinction) would come about
if the Golden Path didn't materialise.
