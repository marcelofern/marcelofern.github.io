## Marcus who?

Marcus Aurelius (121 - 180 AD) was a Roman emperor from 161 to 180, and also a
stoic philosopher. He inherited the empire from his uncle Antonius Pius after
the later died. Marcus was educated at home, as most aristocratic children
those days. He was taught by masters from different areas, and learned oratory
from two of the most esteemed orators of their time, Herodes Atticus and
Caninius Celer.

"Meditations" is a compilation of several excerpts from Marcus Aurelius diary.
The book as it came to be, is further divided in 12 smaller books, which
represent different periods of his life. The collection is neither in
chronological order nor was intended to be read by anyone but himself.

## Opinions

Marcus' writing style is very distinct from most modern philosophy books. The
text is straight to the point, Marcus does not find use in any jargon or
technically, his writing is nothing but clear and concise.

Aurelius' perspective of time is what gives rise to most of his reasoning. Here
is my interpretation of his ideas: a man can live for several decades, but they
will eventually die. Just as many did before him, and as many will do for
several years after his death. If a man is glorious in his life, and if he is
remembered by many that come after him, these men who remember his legacy will
also eventually die. With their death, his memory also vanishes away. So why
worry about glory? Why worry about legacies? Why fight against Nature? Won't
Nature get back what is hers in due time? If that is so, a man should be
grateful for the time Nature has given to him, and to his existence. Instead of
preoccupying about things that are out of his control, he should direct his
focus towards being a good man, and keeping his ethics to the highest standard.
