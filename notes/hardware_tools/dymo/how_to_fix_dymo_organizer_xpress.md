If Dymo got stuck/jammed just follow these steps to diagnose and fix the issue

## Step 1

When you turn Dymo upside down, there are two screws at the base.

Unscrew them. You can either use a Philips 3.0 screw driver or a flat one that
looks like **−** (also 3.0).

## Step 2

Remove the tape from inside Dymo. Now the concavity is empty.

From inside the concavity, open the Dymo with your thumbs by doing the same
movement you'd do when you are opening a book. This is the easiest way to open
Dymo apart.

Don't be too rough or you might break it. You will have to play with it to find
the right way of opening it, so take your time - it's quite finicky.

Also try to loosen up the upper base where the two screws were, again by
pushing outwards from the middle section cut.

## Step 3

You can now pop the head (it might have popped up already) and unscrew the
little screw at the base. You will need a Philips ph00 to open that one, or
a flat (**−**) driver with the equivalent diameter.

Usually you'll find the offending piece of tape that got Dymo stuck.

## Step 4

Make sure that both grey disks (I call them engines) are aligned by making sure
the two up arrows match the two bottom arrows.

## Step 5

Profit.
