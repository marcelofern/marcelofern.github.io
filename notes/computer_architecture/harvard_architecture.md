Differently from the Neumann architecture, The Harvard architecture has
different storage and buses for code instructions and data.

> Modern processors appear to the user to be systems with von Neumann
> architectures, with the program code stored in the same main memory as the
> data. For performance reasons, internally and largely invisible to the user,
> most designs have separate processor caches for the instructions and data,
> with separate pathways into the processor for each. This is one form of what
> is known as the modified Harvard architecture.

An important note is that:

> A modified Harvard architecture is a variation of the Harvard computer
> architecture that, unlike the pure Harvard architecture, allows memory that
> contains instructions to be accessed as data. Most modern computers that are
> documented as Harvard architecture are, in fact, modified Harvard
> architecture.

> This modification is widespread in modern processors, such as the ARM
> architecture, Power ISA and x86 processors. It is sometimes loosely called a
> Harvard architecture, overlooking the fact that it is actually "modified".

## Use in embedded

> Harvard architecture model is mainly used in microcontrollers:
> microcontrollers have a small program and data memory that needs to be
> accessed simultaneously. However, Harvard architecture is not always used in
> microcontrollers; some microcontroller families use hybrid or Von Neumann
> architecture models.
