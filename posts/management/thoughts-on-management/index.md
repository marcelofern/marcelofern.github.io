# Thoughts On 3 Years of Management

```

I have been managing people for the past 3 years at my current job. This is
not any extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager at
best.

However, I have put some thought on lessons I learnt from managing other
developers and on reoccurring patterns I have observed.

I am curious about how my own management process will evolve in the next three
years, so this post should serve as a comparing ground.

Now, a post about management is not cringe enough unless there is a "top list"
of advice for other managers that summarises my current thinking. The one I
could come up with is composed of 5 **must's**.

1. You must facilitate.
2. You must take an active interest in the development of your reports.
3. You must reassure through real recognition.
4. You must listen.
5. You must keep an open mind about your own management skills.

Having innate charisma would be of great help. However, that is almost out of
one's reach and thus didn't make to the list. The typical nerd type is
usually not charismatic, so we need to work harder on it.

## You Must Facilitate

Being promoted to manage other developers after performing well is a regular
occurrence in many companies. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to not be good at managing their peers.

Promoting a good developer does ensure that the new manager won't be a mere
conduit for communication but they will have experience in the field.

However, The Venn diagram intersection between skills required to be a good
developer and to be a good manager is a narrow one. Facilitation skills don't
seem to regularly feature on the good-developer skill set.

My first challenge stepping into the role was to manage my own conflicts of
interest and lack of guidance and experience on how to manage other people. I
wanted to continue developing my knack for coding as I deemed my
individual-contributor skills more important than management and leadership.

That meant that I wasn't facilitating much. The lack of leadership and
direction quickly tampered the development of one of my teams.

Once that team grew to about ~7 developers the situation became unsustainable.
I wasn't having enough quality time to spend on important coding tasks because
I was constantly spending time on management duties. At the same time I wasn't
helping to unblock my team's work as well as I could since I spent too much
time coding.

To release myself out of this conundrum I had to step back and re-approach the
problem. Being **proactive** about facilitating helped me save time for myself
and to relief stress from my team. This is a cliché, but it is true that
finding the problems before they happen and answering the questions before they
are asked are important to help reduce the stress level of your team.

The easiest kinds of facilitation are the ones defined by a technical problem
in relation to the product being developed. For example, the product manager
asks for a feature but the details aren't translatable for a developer to jump
on the task. You pop a meeting with the product manager and the client, and
together you clear up requirements so that a developer is not stuck in a place
they don't want to be with vague requirements and lack of direction.

The goal in these situations isn't to trace the design for the solution (the
developer will do that), but to make sure requirements are understood and that
there is a definition of what "done" means in the context of that task.

These facilitations aren't hard because they only take time and organising.
I.e., getting the relevant people together in a meeting, and taking the time to
properly write up details of what has been discussed and agreed.

The hardest kinds of facilitation happen when a team member is having a hard
time because of external factors or because of conflicts with colleagues. This
is the real human-factor part of the job. I have little experience on this.
These situations seem to take a lot of time and energy to resolve. Each
situation of this type is different and facilitation might have to be defined
case by case. The tools available by the business will be relevant here and
the manager needs make good use of them. E.g., unlimited leave, team rotation,
mental-health days, external mediation, etc.

## You Must Take An Active Interest In The Development Of Your Reports

Of all the "musts", this is the one that took me the longest to think and write
about. It's hard to find a recipe for what "taking an active interest" is, even
though most people have a good intuition about its meaning.

Different people need different things depending on where they are at their
careers, what they want, and who they are. The first step is learning the
answer to those questions. But there is a meta step here too. Both you and the
report need to be willing to learn and improve together for that relationship
to work and those questions to be answer adequately.

In the best manager-managed relationships I've had **both** people were
learning together about what they needed and what they could provide to each
other. I didn't understand for a very long time that this dynamic was what
nurtured the environment for a great relationship.

Having a manager that allows themselves to not know but are comfortable asking
dumb questions is a **great thing**. I have had managers on the other side of
the spectrum who pretended to be acquainted with things they had no clue about
because they were insecure of showing a potential shortcoming to their reports.
This is a **bad thing**.

It is difficult to provide quality help to develop a report's career if the
manager is not an **active** member of the team. It is hard to relate to
the work of a report if you have no skin in the game. This is why I am in
favour of managers that get their hands dirty on the factory line. This
helps to build team spirit and camaraderie. Frankly, you can provide a much
richer feedback as a manager if you are close to the work yourself.

If you came across this sort of advice below in the past, I recommend you
**don't follow** it:

> managers are usually not part of the teams that they manage. Teams are made
> up of peers, equals that function as equals. The manager is most often
> outside the team, giving occasional direction from above and clearing away
> administrative and procedural obstacles. By definition, the manager is not a
> peer and so can’t be part of the peer group.

Of course there are exceptions where the manager cannot be part of the team.
For example, a project may be so novel that no one except the few reports deep
in the weeds can actively contribute to the advancement of that project.

However, this does not mean that the manager shouldn't do their best to
understand the project as much as possible even if it is just to have support
when collateral damage happens.

It is hard to take an active interest in someone without getting to know them.
So make sure to invest on that relationship and situate yourself within the
company so that you can provide active support for your team. The earlier the
better. It takes time to build trust.

## You Must Listen

"Listening is an active skill" they say, and in this case not only one of
"paying attention" but taking proactive effort to reflect on what has been
reported and to act on it.

Recurring one-on-one meetings are the bare minimum to keep a relationship
flowing, otherwise without the space to exchange ideas, get feedback, or
otherwise just rant, there'll be a barrier between manager and report that
might not serve either.

It is easy to get caught on the "busyness-of-it" and put off 1:1's - both as a
report or as a manager. If this becomes a frequent occurrence it might be
because a potential problem is waiting in ambush.

Here is a cliché list of tips for active listening. It serves well just to
be aware of these things before you jump on a 1:1 with a report:

- Never interrupt. It frustrates your report and affects the full understanding
  of the message. If you have international people in your team, your way of
  communication might differ from theirs. Some cultures tend to provide [low
  context communication whereas others provide high
  context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures).
- Defer judgement. Remain open and neutral. If your report is telling you what
  problems they are going through, it is unhelpful to start expressing your
  personal opinions on the problem without being asked to or without taking
  into consideration social cues for when to do it.
- Avoid distractions. Please, just close Slack.

## You Must Reassure Through Real Recognition

> “People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a
> cooperative team.”

A pat on the back goes a long way, specially when it's done publicly.

Everyone likes to feel like they're winning, progressing, and that there's
validation for their good work. Many software development managers are
introverts and giving compliments is hard. I think that more than a skill that
can be learned, you need to be constantly aware of opportunities to provide
recognitions (this is harder than it sounds).

In some places I worked companies tended to have free-pizza events (or insert
another snack here) to celebrate team achievements. Where there's nothing wrong
with that and celebration is necessary for a team to function, some
organisations tend to over-characterise such acts as proof of their generosity
and reassurance that employees are doing a good job.

I think that most people can see through this over characterisation and that
leaves them with a bitter taste in their mouths. Without proper reassurance and
true recognition, it doesn't matter how many pizza-events there are, people
won't feel reassured and valued on their work. It might even be the opposite:
"why is the company going a long way with such events whereas people aren't
getting paid enough?". [panem et
circenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)

One of the best kinds of recognition is the financial one, specially when that
financial offer is made proactively from the manager's side before "official"
raise ceremonies take place. It is incredible that in certain places salary
raises only happen once a year, and if you missed the date but got a lot of
responsibility on your back, you need to perform the role for a year without
recognition. It is very hard to be a manager in such companies as you don't
have freedom to *really* manage your team.

## You must keep an open mind about your management skills.

Managing is hard, and there is so much material out there that isn't necessary
relevant or particularly useful to **your** situation.

Material on how to manage **creatives** seems particularly scarce, and
creatives seem to require a very different kind of management than the
general "KPI-based" literature often teaches (in my opinion). There is usually
not many clear productive metrics you can track on how much impact a creative
has made (usually in terms of revenue) to the business. Of course you should be
able to tell whether someone is performing to the level of their role, but
overall impact is a harder thing to measure.

All that said, I do think that improving is possible, but it looks very
different than improving technical skills.

It takes a
different source of energy than coding. If you are not a real people person 

Having the "personality for it" or some innate charisma would be of immense
help on performing management duties, but it is not strictly necessary as long
as you are open to work on it.
