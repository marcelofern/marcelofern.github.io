<h1>On Git Commit Messages</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-10-05
</code></pre>
<p>There are two pages that provide a great summary on Git Commits best practice.</p>
<p>I recommend reading them before going through the rest of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20241003132241/https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages">Git Commit Good Practice - OpenStack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240930112522/https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">Tim Pope's note about commit messages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those articles are &quot;old&quot;. One is from 2008 and the other is from 2014. This
means that the following occasional comment pops up now and then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's 2024, do we <strong>really</strong> have to restrict ourselves to 72-long commit
titles? I think it's acceptable to simply:</em></p>
<p>git -m &quot;ISSUE:1234X Add date of birth, salary, ethnicity, pronouns, height (in centimetres), salary text fields, and more, to the request loan submit form for Chameleon MVP.&quot;</p>
<p><em>We also have so many good tools around git that make it easier to see the
changes and the diffs. We can also link to rich context on JIRA and Asana,
why are we focusing so much on terminal limitations?</em></p>
<p><em>We are agile and always fix forward. We never have use for the old bits of
git like git bisect, git revert, or even git log. What do these do again?!.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that I have little to contribute to the excellent content of the
articles above, I'll limit my contribution to explaining why these posts have
aged so well and why they are still relevant in 2024.</p>
<h2>A Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Learning a tool like git takes time. To make the most of git, one needs to
learn it well. The same way that there are programmers who debug exclusively
with <code>print</code> calls, there are programmers who only use three git commands:
<code>pull</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code>.</p>
<p>That is fine, and you can go a long way without ever needing more advanced git
commands (or debugging tools). That also means, however, that some
justification behind certain good-practice advice will be harder to understand.
I will try to make those clearer in this post so that they don't seem so
mystical.</p>
<p>The tragedy of it all is that not knowing those advanced use cases before
creating a repository might jeopardise the ability of advanced users to take
advantage of good commit etiquette. Some code bases have a &quot;before good
commits&quot; and &quot;after good commits&quot;. The &quot;before&quot; is usually a dark place we
don't like to go. So make up your reasons wisely and trust the advice of
people who have been there before and learned the hard lessons.</p>
<h2>The Summary</h2>
<p>Before we go into the reasons why the advice from those posts is still sound,
here is a very short summary of the two articles above:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not mix two unrelated functional changes in the same commit</strong>: It's hard
to review flaws if changes are mixed together. If the commit needs to be
reverted, the two changes need to be untangled first. Similarly, it is harder
to bisect and find which change created a bug if multiple functional changes
are included in a commit.</li>
<li><strong>Do not assume the reviewer uses the same tools as you</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Do not assume the reviewer has access to an external website</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These will provide the justification for seemingly arbitrary things such as
<em>&quot;commit titles should be no longer than 50 characters and commit bodies no
longer than 72 characters&quot;.</em></p>
<h2>Do not mix two unrelated functional changes in the same commit</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>So commit messages to me are almost as important as the code change itself.
Sometimes the code change is so obvious that no message is really required,
but that is very very rare. And so one of the things I hope developers are
thinking about, the people who are actually writing code, is not just the
code itself, but explaining why the code does something, and why some change
was needed. Because that then in turn helps the managerial side of the
equation, where if you can explain your code to me, I will trust the code...</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's start with a <strong>bad</strong> example:</p>
<pre><code>commit e5b18b256c0f4f5d369c62785248632075790867 (HEAD -&gt; master)
Author: John Doe &lt;john.doe@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Sat Oct 5 18:33:21 2024 +1300

    Revamp customer profile page

    This commit:

      - Refactor ResetPassword form UI to reuse textbox component.
      - Add an index to the &quot;users&quot; table to lookup emails faster.
      - Apply compression to user's uploaded profile pictures.
      - Change hash algorithm for profile picture names.
      - Fix broken layout on mobile devices using landscape format.
      - Add a new canary flag to control &quot;Under Maintanence&quot; banner.
</code></pre>
<p>Although John Doe's commit title evokes the idea that there's only one thing
happening, a closer look at the commit description reveals that there are
many unrelated changes sneaking in at the same time.</p>
<p>Why is this bad? Let's start with a simple example.</p>
<p>Suppose the third change <em>&quot;Apply compression to user's uploaded profile
pictures&quot;</em> has a bug. Your <code>profile_update.c</code> file where all the operations for
updating a user's profile live has now a code-path that crashes the server.</p>
<p>Naturally you want to revert that commit, but his colleague, Mary, has changed
one of the UI layout files that John's commit had also touched as part of an
unrelated change:</p>
<pre><code>commit 85cf1a1501a2062dbc9310d6b598dcf72e284cbc (HEAD -&gt; master)
Author: Mary Silva &lt;mary.silva@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Sat Oct 6 20:45:40 2024 +1300

    Upgrade profile page UI layout

    This commit:

      - Move css classes to the new file &quot;user_layout.css&quot;.
      - Refactor text boxes to use the same css style.
      - Remove unreacheable (dead) JavaScript code.
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can't revert John's commit because you got a conflict.</p>
<pre><code>git revert e5b18b256c0f4f5d369c62785248632075790867

CONFLICT (modify/delete): README.md deleted in (empty tree) and modified in
HEAD.  Version HEAD of README.md left in tree.

error: could not revert e5b18b2... Revamp customer profile page
</code></pre>
<p>Even though the bug in the <code>profile_update.c</code> file has nothing to do with the
UI layout in the profile page, by adding all of those changes in a single
commit, John's commit has become a <strong>conflict magnet</strong> that is very hard to
revert.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this case we already knew that John's commit introduced a bug, but what if
we didn't? <code>git bisect</code> is a git tool built for finding <strong>where</strong> a bug was
introduced.</p>
<p>To use <code>git bisect</code> you give it two arguments: A &quot;bad&quot; commit that is known to
<strong>contain</strong> the bug (even if not introduced by that commit itself), and a
&quot;good&quot; commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced.</p>
<p>Bisect will pick a commit in the middle and ask you whether it's &quot;good&quot; or
&quot;bad&quot;. It is up to you to decide. How you do that depends on the project, you
might run the test suite with a test that reproduces the bug, or simply look at
the diff changes. In each iteration, <code>git bisect</code> shrinks the search window
until John's offending commit is found.</p>
<p>However, this commit has two changes in the same <code>profile_update.c</code> file
that causes the bug.</p>
<pre><code>  - Apply compression to user's uploaded profile pictures.
  - Change hash algorithm for profile picture names.
</code></pre>
<p>So which of the changes caused the bug?</p>
<p>It might be complicated to untangle which change actually broke the code,
specially if the compression algorithm and hash algorithm use the same
underling routines.</p>
<p>A final tool that can't be used as well if multiple changes are present in the
same commit is <code>git log -L</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git log -L :&lt;funcname&gt;:&lt;file_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By running the command above, git will display a diff with all the commits
that touched that function. This presents a way to see the &quot;evolution&quot; of a
function over time.</p>
<p>You want commits to be split so that you can see which individual patches made
that function change and what they had to say. Having a single commit with too
much noise makes that more difficult.</p>
<p>If you are not convinced yet, there are many more git tools that are affected
by non-atomic commits. Check the list below and see if you use or may use any
of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git cherry-pick</code>: For applying a specific commit from one branch to another.</li>
<li><code>git blame</code>: Atomic commits give you the direct answer to: &quot;Why was this
change made?&quot;</li>
<li><code>git diff</code>: For seeing one change at a time.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code>: For rebasing, dropping changes, re-editing commit messages, or
adding fix-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like it's reasonable to say that this advice has aged well.</p>
<h2>Do not assume the reviewer uses the same tools as you</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Word-wrapping is a property of the text. And the tool you use to
visualize things cannot know. End result: you do word-wrapping at the
only stage where you can do it, namely when writing it. Not when
showing it.</p>
<p>Some things should not be word-wrapped. They may be some kind of
quoted text - long compiler error messages, oops reports, whatever.
Things that have a certain specific format.</p>
<p>The tool displaying the thing can't know. The person writing the
commit message can. End result: you'd better do word-wrapping at
commit time, because that's the only time you know the difference.</p>
<p>(And the rule is not 80 characters, because you do want to allow the
standard indentation from git log, and you do want to leave some room
for quoting).</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what a long commit looks like with the default pager (<code>less</code> on most
*nix systems).</p>
<p><img src="long_commit.png" alt="long_commit.png"></p>
<p>Those white errors at the side show you where the text was truncated. Although
<code>less</code> supports wrapping text, it may not do it by default depending on how
your OS came configured, etc.</p>
<p>Every command that takes the commit summary (top line) will break. More
examples of such commands are found on Tim Pope's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240930112522/https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">blog
post</a>.</p>
<p>There isn't much I can add here. I think that it is important to have good
writing skills for both commit titles and commit messages. You can see for
yourself how nice <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master/">Linux's kernel git
log</a> is if you need
inspiration.</p>
<p>The kernel has a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst?id=bc7938deaca7f474918c41a0372a410049bd4e13#n664">restrictive line-length
limit</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <code>summary</code> must be no more than 70-75 characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No text gets wrapped or truncated, and everything is nice and in good style.</p>
<p>It is true that there is no strong evidence about what the &quot;ideal&quot; line length
<strong>for coding</strong> is. But we do have that number for <strong>human-readable text</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research has led to recommendations that line length should not exceed about
70 characters per line. The reason behind this finding is that both very
short and very long lines slow down reading by interrupting the normal
pattern of eye movements and movements throughout the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234578707_Optimal_Line_Length_in_Reading--A_Literature_Review">source</a></p>
<p>Throw no stones! We are talking about <strong>human-readable</strong> text like books,
news magazines, papers, <strong>and git logs!</strong>.</p>
<p>As Linus has explained on the quote at the top of this section, the <strong>writer</strong>
is responsible for wrapping the text because the pager tool might not be able
to do it for the <strong>reader</strong>.</p>
<p>The default pager (<code>less</code>) is not the only tool in the park that truncates
instead of wrapping. It's 2024 and we haven't found the magic solution for
perfect text-wrapping yet. Even GitHub truncates long commit titles to 72
characters. Be mindful of that when committing long titles and messages.</p>
<h2>Do not assume the reviewer has access to an external website</h2>
<p>I worked for a company that used to use GitHub for issue tracking as well as
repository hosting. Many of our commit messages merely pointed at GitHub links
and had no description at all.</p>
<p>It was sad to see the company getting acquired and the parent company moving to
BitBucket while deleting the old GitHub account.</p>
<p>It is OK to link to GitHub, Jira, Asana, etc., but the most important thing is
to <strong>make sure</strong> the commit message has everything you need in it so that you
don't depend on external services.</p>
