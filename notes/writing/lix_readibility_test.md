# LIX Readability Test

The LIX readability test measures the reading-level difficulty of a text.

Computing the LIX value involves summing two numbers:

- Average sentence length.
- Percentage of words with more than 6 letters.

A score of 20 means the text reads well.
A score of 60 means the text reads difficultly.

Try to keep the score below 35.
