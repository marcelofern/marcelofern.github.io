<h2>title: Going places. Migration, Economics, and the Future of New Zealand
author: Marcelo Fernandes
date: October 23, 2023</h2>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>Here're some of the pertinent quotes I found from this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The international evidence makes it clear that whether aggregate supply or
demand effects dominate depends very much on the characteristics of the
migrants and the labour markets they enter. For example, a former member of the
Bank of England's Monetary Policy Comitte, David Blanchflower, argues that
migration reduced British inflation pressures during the mid 2000s. He says
aggregate supply effects dominated there during that period because the
majority of migrants planned to return home within two years, so they saved
most of their earnings and did not contribute much to demand. We conclude that,
in New Zealand, the quality and diversity of migrants matters more than their
raw numbers when it comes to overall economic impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>We see growing arrivals from Asia in the migration numbers, and we see even
more pronounced changes in New Zealand's goods trade. Both reflect growing
Asian economic influence, and in particular the economic rise of China. China
is now NZ's largest trading partner for imports and exports of goods. It is
also one of the top five sources of migrants for Australia, Canada, and the US
as well as New Zealand, and the main source of foreign-born students in the US,
UK, Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand. (...) Along with the growth in
trade with Asia, there has been a relative reduction in the importance of trade
with other places, especially the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Research into the impact of migration on the housing market has produced
unusual results. One study for the Reserve Bank by Andrew Coleman and John
Landon-Lane found that in the short term a net migration gain equal to 1 per
cent of the population raised house prices by about 10 per cent at the national
level. Later work for the Bank by Chris McDonald found a 1 per cent increase in
the population caused an 8 per cent increase in house prices over the following
three years, with increasing arrivals having more effect than reducing
departures.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>British economic geographers Max Nathan and Neil Lee provide evidence from
London that more diverse teams are more innovative.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In a recent paper by Giovanni Peri and others say that STEM workers are the
main drivers of productivity growth in the US, and that immigrant STEM workers
in particular have had a significant positive impact on productiviy.
Separately, Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle report that
immigrant graduate students patent at double the rate of their American-born
colleagues, reflecting the fact that immigrants disproportionately hold science
and engineering degrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In NZ, Stillman and Mare found that university-qualified migrants achieved wage
and emplyment outcomes similar to those of locals more quickly than less
skilled migrants did.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, competition for jobs from migrants could increase unemployment or
reduce wages for existing workers. But the evidence is that any detrimental
impacts on existing resident's employment or wages are small and short-term.</p>
