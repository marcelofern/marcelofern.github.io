This was the first novel from Dostoevsky that I've managed to read, even
though I had it on my list for a long while.

The book was great. A story not like anything I've read before. The characters
are very dramatic, and sound very eloquent for poor Russian peasants, but it
just adds to the nature of the novel.

Dostoevsky dives deep into the psyche of Raskolnikov, the poor but bright
student who sets a plan to kill a pawnbroker who, according to him, is evil and
a menace to society.

The narrative takes you back to Russia in the mid 1800's, with the miserable
weather, the poverty, the sick, the aristocracy, and the general demographics
of the time all painting a picture of Russia's toughness in the back of your
head.

The pacing on the beginning of the book is fantastic, the middle drags on a bit,
but the ending is incredibly beautiful as Raskolnikov struggles with guilt,
honour, and seeks for his redemption through Sonya's love (his partner then).
