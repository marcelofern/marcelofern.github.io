<h1>Review</h1>
<p><img src="history-of-philosophy-grayling.jpg" alt="history-of-philosophy-grayling"></p>
<h2>The whole history of philosophy?!</h2>
<p>A. C. Grayling has put considerable effort into summarising a complex and
extensive subject. He manages to answer the eminent questions that emerge from
someone starting their philosophy studies: &quot;Where to begin? Who should I
include in my studies? How much depth of content can I afford without being
either too superficial or too detailed?&quot;</p>
<p>The list of names studied in this book isn't brief. It starts from the
pre-socratics, goes through Plato, the medievals, the renascence, and finally
arrives at modern philosophy. But the book doesn't end before giving a short
overview of asian, indian, arabic, and african philosophy. It is worth noting
that a short appendix about logic is also included.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I decided to read this book after doing some research on books that best
accommodate an overview of thinkers, their ideas, and their times. I ended up
between Grayling, and Bertrand Russell's &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;. It
isn't easy to not choose Russell. The man who wrote the incomparable
&quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; couldn't have done a poor job at analysing history
itself. So why didn't I decide to go for Russell's instead? Well, maybe I am
going to read Russell's book at some point in the future anyway, but for now
I was actually interested in western philosophy as well as non-western
philosophy, therefore I had no choice but to go for Grayling.</p>
<p>After reading all the 600+ pages of this book, I finished it with no regrets.
The book isn't perfect, though. The style of writing is not the one that I
prefer the most. There is a lack of active voice in the text that makes
philosophical concepts - that are already hard to grasp - even more distant.
The author uses some philosophic jargon here and there without prior
introduction. Perhaps some very important concepts that evolved through the
course of history, such as &quot;soul&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, and &quot;consciousness&quot;, should be
covered in such a book, but maybe that is an unfair request, since there are
exclusively dedicated books for these subjects.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the book is a great reading for the one interested in &quot;how things
came to be&quot; in the realm of philosophy. It also serves as a good catalogue that
comes in handy if one wants to have a high-level view of certain philosopher's
ideas, or school of thoughts.</p>
