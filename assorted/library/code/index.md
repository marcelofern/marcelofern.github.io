# Review

This book is interesting for those who're looking for a high-level historical
overview of how we ended up having the computers we have today. It's an easy
book to read in the beginning, but it quickly becomes harder as multiple
concepts start to pack up.

It starts with very basic examples teaching the reader how a simple circuit
with a lamp works. It then uses this knowledge to build a small summation
circuit, and to then evolve it into a more sophisticated (yet basic) computer.

The way the author presents the information is in a linear history-telling way.
This made it easier for me to follow what is presented as an information
evolution of transmitting simple signals through copper wires (a telegraph) to
interacting with complex signals the way we do today.

Each chapter of the book introduces a concept. On a high-level it goes like
this:

- Morse code and Braille
- Telegraph systems
- Boolean logic
- Circuits
- Memory
- Von Neumann Machines
- Peripherals
- GUI Interfaces

I feel a bit more appreciation for the computer engineering field after
reading this book. No, it didn't make me a better developer directly, but it
has satiated some of my curiosity on the topic :-)

One thing that wasn't great was that the author rushed at the end. This is a
bit of a shame, because we're very high level at that point, so taking a few
pages to go deeper into the content would have made a lot of sense.
