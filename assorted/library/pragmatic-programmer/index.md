TLDR: This is the kind of book I wish I had read before taking my first job as
a developer. Though I probably wouldn't get as much from it as I did by
reading it today as I reflect on my experience so far.

The Pragmatic Programmer was originally written in 1999. Fast forward to 2022
and the book feels like it was written yesterday.

This book shows history repeating itself. The good and bad patterns talked
about back in 1999 propagate all the way towards today's software developement
era. In all the companies and cultures that I had worked with: Brazil,
Argentina, U.S, and New Zealand; these patterns came up.

The book talks alot about professionalism. Taking responsibility. Knowing that
testing is not only important, but fundamental. Leaving code better than it was
when you interacted with it for the first time. Understanding the importance of
refactoring. Taking the time to make things good, and to making them rigt.

The last one on that list has been a stone in my shoe for a very long time. I
am guilty of enjoying delivering things quickly and in vast amounts (who
doesn't?). I also put myself under false pretences that if I don't maintain
a decent throughput I am going to be fired or scrutinised somehow. That is
self-sabotage at its finest. I am sure other programmers feel the same way.

The problem is, every little issue that we leave behind in order to deliver
things quickly, be it a test that you can't bare to write, be it a little
refactoring that you are going to leave until tomorrow (never), means that
someone else will have to get to it later.

Reasons may vary, but someone will have to deal with it and at that point
chances are the problem has become bigger. By ignoring problems and allowing
ourselves to go faster individually, we made everyone else go slow.

In conclusion I think this is a book I will have to read over and over again so
that the principles and values can be hammered against my brain. Sometimes we
slack off and need to be reminded of good work etiquette and for that we need
to wear our pragmatic programmer hat (-:
