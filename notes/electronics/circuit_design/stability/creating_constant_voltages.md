## Zener Diodes

> Zeners are used to create a constant voltage inside a circuit somewhere,
> simply done by providing them with a (roughly constant) current derived from
> a higher voltage within the circuit.

However...

> When thinking about zeners, itâ€™s worth remembering that low-voltage units
> (e.g., 3.3 V) behave rather poorly, in terms of constancy of voltage versus
> current (Figure 1.17); if you think you need a low voltage zener, use a
> two-terminal reference instead (also called IC voltage reference).

See my notes on zener diodes for more info.

## IC Voltage Reference

Preferred over zener diodes for low voltages.
