<p>My primary motivation for using <code>avr-gcc</code> at the moment is for compiling assembly to an Arduino Uno using ATMega328p.</p>
<p>The building process of an assembly file through avr-gcc is as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The assembly file goes through the preprocessor, where all macros are evaluated, and comments are removed.</li><li>The assembly code needs to be converted to an object/elf file. This file is generated by an _assembler_. This type of file holds the opcode for the particular architecture along with the data for the program (strings, constants, etc.), plus some other metadata.</li><li>Your code may require code from other libraries, or from other files. A _linker_ will link all of the necessary files into a single program with an obvious entry point.</li><li>This program now gets converted to a HEX file, which will transform the previous file with all opcodes into something that can be uploaded directly to the flash.</li></ol>
<p>The avr-gcc compiler also includes the following tools:</p>
<ul><li>Assembler: avr-as</li><li>Linker: avr-ld</li><li>Section and program sizes: avr-size</li><li>Object file management: avr-objcopy and avr-objdump</li></ul>
