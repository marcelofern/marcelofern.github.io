## SICP

I'm starting this book on 2024-05-19 and plan to read something here and there
whenever time allows me to do so.

At present I have no ambition of even finishing this book, but given it is in
my list of "classic CS books that have withstood the test of time", I'll try
to give it a fair go.

## Tools

I am currently using `guile` to compile the Scheme code that I write in neovim.

So far the code examples have been basic, so I haven't had a chance to look
into other proper tools in detail. I found `guile` in the list of Scheme tools
in the Arch wiki, and noticed it was already installed in my system as a
dependency and that's the only reason I chose it.

## Exercises

The list of exercises includes a simple explanation of necessary theory to
solve the exercises without going too much into the detail. The book itself
should be the primary source, but having read it, the basic explanations should
be enough to remember the subject.
