The first Stephen King book that I read. It was a slow start but once it kicked
in (after about 1/3 of the book) I couldn't put it down.

Perhaps it's too early after a pandemic to have read this book (having done so in
2025 when COVID-19 was just around the corner), but a comment in the internet
suggested that it was an interesting set up for showing how bad a strong pandemic
could play out. It delivered.

I'm writing this little review pretty late. I'm on my 3rd S.K. book at the
moment, and I feel too busy and invested reading it (The Dome) to stop and
write down a proper review of this book. Sorry!!
