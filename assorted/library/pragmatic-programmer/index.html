<h1 class="title">Pragmatic Programmer</h1>
<p class="author">Marcelo Fernandes</p>
<p class="date">January 21, 2022</p>
</header>
<h1 id="review">Review</h1>
<p>TLDR: This is the kind of book I wish I had read before taking my
first job as a developer.</p>
<p>The Pragmatic Programmer was originally written in 1999. Fast forward
to 2022 and the book feels like it was written just yesterday.</p>
<p>I read through this book smiling and nodding all the time, thinking
about all the people in my life that were perfectly tailored to suit the
examples (good and bad) provided by this book.</p>
<p>“How come this feels like history repeating itself? How come the
patterns talked about in this book back in 1999 were propagating all the
way towards the mid 2010’s, in all the companies and cultures that I had
worked with: Brazil, Argentina, U.S, New Zealand?” These were just a few
questions resonating in the back of my mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>All in all, what I loved the most about this process was how the book
helped me to become a better professional. Here is a quote that shook me
up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wrote this, and I stand behind my work.” Your signature should
come to be recognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your
name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested,
and documented. A really professional job. Written by a real
professional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And should we expect anything less? This is what professionalism in
the context of software development is all about. Taking responsibility.
Knowing that testing is not only important, but fundamental. Leaving
code better than it was when you interacted with it for the first time.
Understanding the importance of refactoring. Taking the time to make
things good, and to making them rigt.</p>
<p>The last one on that list has been a stone in my shoe for a very long
time. I am guilty of enjoying delivering things quickly, and in vast
amounts. I mean, who doesn’t? I also put myself under the false
pretences that if I don’t maintain a decent throughput I am going to be
fired, or scrutinised somehow. That is self-sabotage at its finest, and
I am pretty sure a lot of other programmers feel the same way.</p>
<p>The problem is, every little issue that we leave behind in order to
deliver things quickly, be it a test that you can’t bare to write, be it
a little refactoring that you are going to leave until tomorrow (never),
means that someone else will have to get to it later. Reasons may vary,
but someone will have to deal with it and at that point chances are the
problem has become bigger. By ignoring problems and allowing ourselves
to go faster individually, we made everyone else go slow. This doesn’t
sound very professional, does it? It’s because it is not. It is selfish,
and it is not a long term behaviour that will pay off.</p>
<p>In conclusion I think this is a book I will have to read over and
over again so that the principles and values can be hammered against my
brain. Sometimes we slack off and need to be reminded of good work
etiquette and for that we need to wear our pragmatic programmer hat.</p>
