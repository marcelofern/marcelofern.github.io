# Exercise 1.2

## Pre-exercise Theory

**Prefix Form** is the "convention of placing the operator to the left of the
operands".

One advantage of this form is that it can take any amount of arguments without
any ambiguity:

```scm
(+ 42 77 12)
```

The other advantage is that nesting operations are also simple and unambiguous:

```scm
(+ 42 (- 77 12))
```

A good way of formatting prefix operations is by aligning the operands of an
expression vertically, so that by looking at the indentation one can follow
which operations go together:

```scm
; without pretty-print
(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))

; with pretty-print
(+ (* 3
      (+
          (* 2 4)
          (+ 3 5)
      )
    )
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6
   )
)

## Problem

> Translate the following expression into prefix form:

```
5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + 4/5)))
-----------------------------
        3(6 - 2)(2 - 7)
```

The total of this division is = -0.246 or -37/150

```scm
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
; -37/150

; pretty-print format:


(/ 
    (+ 5
       4
       (- 2
          (- 3
             (+ 6
                (/ 4 5)
             )
          )
       )
    )
    (* 3
       (- 6 2)
       (- 2 7)
    )
)
```
