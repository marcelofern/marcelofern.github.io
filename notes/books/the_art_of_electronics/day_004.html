<h1>Day 4</h1>
<pre><code class="language-">Created at: 2025-01-15
</code></pre><p>Today I'm finally starting chapter 1!</p>
<p>I have a degree in Electrical Engineering, but I've finished that a while ago and am probably rusty. No bad in getting a refresher.</p>
<h2>Interesting Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>A mid-century computer (the IBM 650) cost $300,000, weighed 2.7 tons, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>contained 126 lamps on its control panel; in an amusing reversal, a</blockquote>
<blockquote>contemporary energy-efficient lamp contains a computer of greater capability</blockquote>
<blockquote>within its (physical) base, and costs about $10.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is often the case that the panel controls and cabinet hardware of an</blockquote>
<blockquote>instrument cost more than the electronics inside.</blockquote>
<h2>Voltage</h2>
<p><b>Intuitive Explanation</b>: What you apply to a circuit to make currents flow.</p>
<p><b>Enhanced Definition</b>: The voltage between two points is the cost in energy (work) to move positive charge from a more negative point (lower potential) to a more positive point (higher potential). Equivalently, the energy released when a unit charge moves "downhill" from the higher potential to the lower.</p>
<p><b>Symbols</b>: Often denoted by <i>V</i>, sometimes by <i>E</i>.</p>
<p><b>Nicknames</b>: Potential Difference or Electromotive Force.</p>
<p><b>Unit of Measure</b>: Volt (V)</p>
<h2>Current</h2>
<p><b>Symbol</b>: <i>I</i></p>
<p><b>Definition</b>: The rate of flow of electric charge past a point.</p>
<p><b>Unit of Measure</b>: Ampere (or amp).</p>
<p><b>Fun fact</b>: A current of 1 amp equals a flow of 1 coulomb (<code>6*10^18</code> electrons) of charge per second.</p>
<p><b>Conventions</b>: In a circuit, current flows from a more positive point to a more negative one, even though the actual electron flow is in the opposite direction!</p>
<h2>Important Rules</h2>
<ol><li>Kirchhoff's current law (KCL): The sum of currents into a point in a circuit equals the sum of the currents out. Such a point is often referred to as a node.</li></ol>
<p>2. Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL): Parallel connections have the same voltage across them. This also means that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed circuit is zero.</p>
<p>3. The power (energy per unit time) consumed by a circuit device is: <code>P = VI</code>. - P is in watts. - A 55W bulb connected at 220V plug has 0.25 amps through it. - When dealing with periodic signals, P=VI deal with _average power_.</p>
<p>4. Ohm's law: <code>R = V/I</code>.</p>
<h2>Resistors</h2>
<pre><code class="language-">R(series) = R1 + R2

R(parallel) = (R1*R2) / (R1 + R2)

Alternatively...

R(parallel) = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2)
</code></pre><p>Tip: By parallelising resistors you <b>always get a smaller resistance</b>.</p>
<p>Trivia:</p>
<ul><li>Usually made of some conducting stuff (carbon, thin metal, carbon film, wire of poor conductivity...) and characterised by its resistance:</li></ul>
<ul><li>Most frequent resistors come in values from 1Ω to 10MΩ.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Also characterised by how much power they can <i>safely</i> dissipate. Usually around 1/4W or 1/8W</li></ul>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<blockquote>1.1 You have a 5k resistor and a 10k resistor. What is their combined</blockquote>
<blockquote>resistance (a) in series and (b) in parallel?</blockquote>
<p>(a): 15k (b): 50k/15k = 3.333k</p>
<blockquote>1.2 If you place a 1 ohm resistor across a 12 volt car battery, how much power</blockquote>
<blockquote>will it dissipate?</blockquote>
<p>P = VI V = 12V I = V/R = 12A P = 144W</p>
<blockquote>1.3 Prove the formulas for series and parallel resistors.</blockquote>
<p>Given that:</p>
<ol><li>Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL): Parallel connections have the same voltage across them. This also means that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed circuit is zero.</li><li>Kirchhoff's current law (KCL): The sum of currents into a point in a circuit equals the sum of the currents out. Such a point is often referred to as a node.</li><li>Ohm's law: <code>R = V/I</code>.</li></ol>
<p>Imagine a circuit that has one voltage source and two resistors, all connected in series. Where:</p>
<pre><code class="language-">- V1         = voltage across R1.
- V2         = voltage across R2.
- I1         = current across R1.
- I2         = current across R2.
- V          = power supply.
- R(series)  = resulting resistance of the circuit in series.
- I          = corrent through power supply.
</code></pre><p>From 1., <code>V = V1 + V2</code> From 2., <code>I1 = I2 = V</code> From 3., <code>R(series) = V/I</code></p>
<p>From ohm's law:</p>
<pre><code class="language-">V1 = R1 * I1 = R1 * I
V2 = R2 * I2 = R2 * I

V = R1 * I + R2 * I
R(series) = V/I = (R1 * I + R2 * I)/I

Therefore
R(series) = R1 + R2
</code></pre><p>Now for the parallel case let's imagine that V, R1, and R2 are connected in parallel.</p>
<p>From 1., <code>V = V1 = V2</code> From 2., <code>I = I1 + I2</code> From 3., <code>R(parallel) = V/I</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-">I1 = V1/R1 = V/R1
I2 = V2/R2 = V/R2

R(parallel) = V/I = V/(V/R1 + V/R2)

Therefore
R(parallel) = 1/(R1 + R2)
