<h1>Sinusoidal Signals</h1>
<pre><code class="language-">Created at: 2025-02-04
</code></pre><p>Wave function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-">V = A sin(2π f t + φ )

# OR

V = A sin ω t.

# Note that

2π f t ↔ ω
</code></pre><p>Common nomenclature:</p>
<ul><li><b>peak-to-peak amplitude</b> (pp amplitude) ↔ twice the amplitude.</li><li><b>root-mean-square amplitude</b> (rms amplitude), which is Vrms = √(1/2)A = 0.707A (this is for sinewaves only; the ratio of pp to rms will be different for other waveforms).Odd as it may seem, this is the usual method, because rms voltage is what’s used to compute power. The nominal voltage across the terminals of a wall socket (in the United States) is 120 volts rms, 60 Hz. The amplitude is 170 volts (339 volts pp).</li></ul>
