<h1>Review</h1>
<p>This book is a biography of Richard Stallman's, mostly focused on his work on
Free Software. It's given me some insights into the early days of the GNU
project, along with important context of what was happening during the raise of
the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The book is written in 2002, so it does not include a lot of the most recent
polemical events around Richard Stallman's opinions on various subjects.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting quotes I've taken from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to copyrighted works, Stallman says he divides the world into
three categories. The first category involves &quot;functional&quot; works. E.g.,
software programs, dictionaries, and textbooks. The second category involves
works that might be best described as &quot;testimonial&quot; e.g., scientific papers and
historical documents. Such works serve a purpose that would be undermined if
subsequent readers or authors were free to modify the work a will. The final
category involves works of personal expression e.g., diaries, journals, and
autobiographies. To modify such documents would be to alter a person's
recollections or point of view. Stallman considers ethically unjustifiable. Of
the tree categories, the first should give users the unlimited right to make
modified versions, while the second and third should regulate that right
according to the will of the original author. Regardless of category, however,
the freedom to copy and redistribute non-commercially should remain unabridged
at all times. Stallman insists. If that means giving the internet users the
right to generate a hundred copies of an article, image, song, or book, and
then email the copies to a hundred strangers, so be it. &quot;It's clear that
private occasional redistribution must be permitted, because only a police
state can stop that.&quot; Stallman says. &quot;It's antisocial to come between people
and their friends. Napster has convinced me that we also need to permit, must
permit, even non-commercial redistribution to the public for the fun of it.
Because so many people want to do that and find it so useful.&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today's internet companies use patents as a way to stake out individual
applications and business models, the most notorious example being Amazon.com's
2000 attempt to patent the company's &quot;one-click&quot; online shopping process.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Emacs was initially a text editor, Says Stallman. Eventually it became a way of
life for many and a religion for some. We call this religion the Church of
Emacs.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Eric Raymond, an early member of the GNU Emacs team and later Stallman critic,
says the problem was largely institutional. &quot;The FSF got arrogant&quot;, Raymond
says. &quot;They moved away from the goal of doing a production-ready operating
system to doing operating-system research&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarised Raymond, &quot;I think Linu's cleverest and most consequential hack was
not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention of
the Linux development model.</p>
