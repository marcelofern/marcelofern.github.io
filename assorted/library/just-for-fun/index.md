# Review

This is quite an "old" book. It was published in 2002. But this is also the
reason why this book is so interesting. It provides an insight into the early
days of Linux.

When the book was written, Linux was in its first decade. Things were a little
different then. Linus talks through the infancy of Linux (and the war against
Minix) all the way up to what was going on at the time the book was written.
How he was, for example, being paid by a company to do software work for the
first time. The book also brings about a major inspiration for him, another
book called "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" by Andrew S.
Tanenbaum, which I hope to read some other day.

Surprisingly, I ended up learning a little bit about Finland. Like their
obsession for saunas, and their education system (through the narrative of
Linus about his childhood).

All in all, the book is fun, easy to read, and insightful in strange (and niche)
ways.
