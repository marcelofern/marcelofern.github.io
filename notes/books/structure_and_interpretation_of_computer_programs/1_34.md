# Exercise 1.34

## Question

Suppose we define the procedure

```scm
(define (f g) (g 2))
```

Then we have

```scm
(f square)
; 4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
; 6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination
(f f)? Explain?

## Answer

```scm
(define (f g) (g 2))

; becomes
(f 2)
; becomes
(2 2)
```

Which returns the error `Wrong type to apply: 2` because 2 is not a procedure,
so it yields invalid syntax.
