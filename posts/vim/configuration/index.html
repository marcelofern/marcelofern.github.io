<h2>title: Vim
author: Marcelo Fernandes
date: August 31, 2020</h2>
<h1>VIM (for software engineers)</h1>
<p>I came across vim for the first time when I needed to edit a file on a remote
server. The first Google result pointed me towards two tools: Vim and Nano. I
tried vim first. As I began typing, the most insane things started to happen:
words being deleted, the cursor going up and down, a nightmare. I freaked out
and forcefully killed the terminal because I didn't know how to close vim. I
then tried Nano. After that prior experience, I was happy to press and hold the
arrow key down to the line I needed to delete, and then proceeded to hold the
delete key for all its 100 characters or so.</p>
<p>It wasn't until later that I would understand what I just missed. During a few
code-pairing sections I witnessed my ex-colleague at work
<a href="https://github.com/ramonsaraiva">ramonsaraiva</a> working with vim. I was sold
after I asked him a few questions about his environment. That was a triggering
point that ended up on my own customised vim workflow.</p>
<h2>Should I learn vim?</h2>
<p>If you only poke around files occasionally, customising vim is probably not
worth the effort. But if you work as a software engineer you probably spend a
lot of time browsing and editing text files. Having knowledge of an advanced
text editor becomes an asset.</p>
<p>One thing preventing people of using vim is the use of movement commands.
Although they can look intimidating at first, there is logic to them. Once they
are familiar, you will edit text faster than in other editors. If you spend a
long enough time, you will be able to start &quot;guessing&quot; new movement commands
because you know what the fundamentals are. But be aware that to learn vim you
will need to dedicate some time to it. But it will be worth it.</p>
<h2>My setup</h2>
<p>This is what my setup looks like</p>

<h2>Main Plugins</h2>
<p>The ones I can't live without include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gruvbox (theme)</li>
<li>Telescope (fuzzy finder)</li>
<li>Easymotion</li>
<li>Fugitive and Gitgutter</li>
</ul>
