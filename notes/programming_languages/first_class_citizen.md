# First-class citizen

> In a given programming language design, a first-class citizen[a] is an entity
> which supports all the operations generally available to other entities.

From the SICP book:

> Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have first-class status.
> Some of the "rights and privileges" of first-class elements are:

> - They may be named by variables.
> - They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
> - They may be returned as the results of procedures.
> - They may be included in data structures.

Further from wikipedia:

> In many older languages, arrays and strings are not first-class: they cannot
> be assigned as objects or passed as parameters to a subroutine. For example,
> neither Fortran IV nor C supports array assignment, and when they are passed
> as parameters, only the position of their first element is actually
> passedâ€”their size is lost. C appears to support assignment of array pointers,
> but in fact these are simply pointers to the array's first element, and again
> do not carry the array's size.
