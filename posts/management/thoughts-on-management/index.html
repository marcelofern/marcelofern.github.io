<h1>Thoughts on 3 years of management</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-09-18
</code></pre>
<p>I've been managing for the past 3 years at my current job. This is not
extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager.</p>
<p>As I reflect on my journey, I talk through lessons learnt from managing
other developers and on recurring patterns I have observed.</p>
<p>Now, a post about management is not cringe enough unless it includes an &quot;advice
top list&quot;.</p>
<p>The one I could come up with is made of 5 <strong>must's</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You must facilitate.</li>
<li>You must take active interest in the development of your reports.</li>
<li>You must reassure through <em>real</em> recognition.</li>
<li>You must listen.</li>
<li>You must keep an open mind about your own management skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Having innate charisma would greatly help. It'd make easier to perform
most points above. Sadly the nerdy type often lacks charisma. We need
to work harder on it. More on that later.</p>
<h2>You Must Facilitate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible
for people to work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being promoted to manager after performing well as a developer is a regular
occurrence in many companies. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to not be good at managing their peers.</p>
<p>Promoting a good developer has many positives. It ensures that the new
manager won't be a mere conduit for communication. Having experience in the
field helps facilitate technical discussions.</p>
<p>However, The Venn diagram intersection between skills required to be a good
developer and to be a good manager is narrow. Facilitation skills do not
regularly feature on the good-developer skill set as much as they should.</p>
<p>I did not have guidance and mentorship once I became a manager. On top of that,
I wanted to keep coding at the same pace as before. This situation made it
harder for me to manage my own conflicts of interested between coding and
managing.</p>
<p>That meant that I wasn't facilitating much. The lack of leadership and
direction quickly hampered the development of one of my teams.</p>
<p>Once that team grew to about ~7 developers the situation became unsustainable.</p>
<p>I wasn't having quality time to spend on important coding tasks because I was
constantly on management duties. At the same time I wasn't helping to unblock
my team's work as well as I could since I spent considerable time coding.</p>
<p>By sheer luck, the team was independent enough to perform well without strong
management guidance. That could equally have been the other way around.</p>
<p>I had to step back and rethink my approach so that I could balance facilitation
duties against coding responsibilities.</p>
<p>Being <strong>proactive</strong> about facilitation helped save time for myself and to
relieve stress from my team. It sounds cliché, but finding problems before they
happen and answering the questions before they are asked are important to help
reduce stress across your team.</p>
<p>The most important thing was realising that unblocking 7 people and letting
them do good work was more important than me, as a single contributor, writing
some of the code.</p>
<p>This didn't make my work easier, though. There are many ways to facilitate
progress, and some situations are harder than others.</p>
<p>Technical facilitation is usually straight forward. For example, the product
manager asks for a feature but the details aren't clear enough for a developer
to jump on the task. You pop a meeting with the client and the P.M. Together
you clear up requirements so that a developer is not stuck with vague
requirements and lack of direction.</p>
<p>The goal isn't to detail the design for the solution (the developer will do
that). Instead, the goal is to make sure requirements are understood and there
is a definition of what &quot;done&quot; means for that task.</p>
<p>Technical facilitation only takes time and organising. I.e., getting the
relevant people together and taking the time to write up the details of what
was discussed and agreed.</p>
<p>My experience as a developer helped greatly in these areas. I was already used
to going to client meetings and explaining what was possible versus what was
not possible. I also frequently helped clients with estimations backed up
by my knowledge of the tech and current architecture of the project.</p>
<p>The hard type of facilitation is the human one. For example, when a team member
is having a hard time because of external factors or conflicts between
colleagues. This is the real human-factor part of the job. I have little
experience on this.</p>
<p>These situations take a lot of time and energy to solve. Each situation of this
type is different and facilitation might have to be defined on a case-by-case
basis.</p>
<p>The tools available by the business will be relevant here and the manager needs
to be aware of them to be able to put them to good use. E.g., unlimited leave,
team rotation, mental-health days, external mediation, etc.</p>
<p>My general observation is to treat the situation with compassion and empathy.
In the end of the day a manager will be dealing with people-problems
frequently. In the eyes of the person being troubled, their problems will be
be more concerning than they may be comfortable telling you. You are at the
risk of miss-characterising the problem if you don't take it seriously.</p>
<p>There is little point in trying to play a hard hand as an authoritarian
manager that only dictates solutions without taking the time to care and
understand the situation. <em>&quot;It's your job, just do it!&quot;</em>. This almost
always goes wrong and makes the manager lose respect even from the people not
involved in the situation. Luckily this is something I learned from observation
and not from direct experience.</p>
<h2>You Must Take An Active Interest In The Development Of Your Reports</h2>
<p>Of all the &quot;musts&quot;, this is the one that took me the longest to think and write
about. It's hard to find a recipe for what &quot;taking an active interest&quot; is, even
though most people have a good intuition about what this phrase means.</p>
<p>Different people need different things depending on where they are at their
careers, what they want to achieve, and who they are.</p>
<p>The first step is understanding what each report needs based on their career
stage, goals, and personality. But there is a meta step here too. Both you and
the report need to be willing to learn and improve together for that
relationship to work and those questions to be answered. It's not just about
the report's growth but also the manager's willingness to evolve in response to
their team's needs.</p>
<p>In the best manager-managed relationships I have had, <strong>both</strong> people were
learning together what they needed from each other and what they could provide.</p>
<p>To use an analogy from pedagogy theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the students-of-the-teacher
cease to exist and a new term emerges: teacher-student with
students-teachers. The teacher is no longer merely the-one-who-teaches, but
one who is himself taught in dialogue with the students, who in turn while
being taught also teach. They become jointly responsible for a process in
which all grow − Paulo Freire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a manager that allows themselves to not know but are comfortable asking
dumb questions is a <strong>great thing</strong>. I had managers on the other side of the
spectrum who pretended to be acquainted with things they had no clue about. I
believe they were insecure about showing potential shortcomings to their
reports. This strikes me as a <strong>bad thing</strong>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to provide quality help to develop a report's career if the
manager is not an <strong>active</strong> member of the team in some capacity.</p>
<p>It is hard to relate to the work of a report if you have no skin in the game.</p>
<p>This is why I am in favour of managers that get their hands dirty on the
factory line at least some of the time, even if only on smaller tasks.</p>
<p>This helps building team spirit and camaraderie. Frankly, you can provide a
much richer feedback as a manager if you are close to the work yourself.</p>
<p>That is not to say that there aren't exceptions where the manager cannot be
part of the team. For example, a project may be so novel that no one except the
few reports deep in the weeds can actively contribute to the advancement of
that project.</p>
<p>This problem also seem to occur the higher up the management chain you go. It
must be difficult for the manager-of-managers to stay on top of each manager's
team work.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the manager shouldn't try their best to
understand the project. Even if it is to support the team when collateral
damage happens.</p>
<p>It is hard to take an active interest in someone without getting to know them.
Make sure to invest in the relationship early as it takes time to build trust.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily popular advice. The book Peopleware makes this
observation below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>managers are usually not part of the teams that they manage. Teams are made
up of peers, equals that function as equals. The manager is most often
outside the team, giving occasional direction from above and clearing away
administrative and procedural obstacles. By definition, the manager is not a
peer and so can’t be part of the peer group. (Peopleware).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend to not take the hierarchical manager as an
example. It may work in certain business areas, but I haven't seen it working
well in software development so far.</p>
<h2>You Must Listen</h2>
<p>&quot;Listening is an active skill&quot;. In this case not only one of &quot;paying attention&quot;
but taking proactive effort to reflect on what has been reported and to act on
it.</p>
<p>A good way of creating space for listening is through recurring one-on-one
meetings. Those are the minimum to keep a relationship flowing. Otherwise,
without the space to exchange ideas, get feedback, or otherwise just rant,
there'll be a barrier between manager and report that might not serve either.</p>
<p>It is easy to get caught on the &quot;busyness-of-it&quot; and put off 1:1's - both as a
report or as a manager. If this becomes a frequent occurrence it might be
because of a potential underlying problem.</p>
<p>Here is a small list of tips for active listening. It serves well just to be
aware of these things before you jump on a 1:1 with a report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never interrupt. It frustrates your report and affects the full understanding
of the message. If you have international people in your team, your way of
communication might differ from theirs. Some cultures tend to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures">low
context communication whereas others provide high
context</a>.</li>
<li>Defer judgement. Remain open and neutral. If your report is telling you what
problems they are going through, it is unhelpful to start expressing your
personal opinions on the problem without being asked to or without taking
into consideration social cues for when to do it.</li>
<li>Avoid distractions. Please, just close Slack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>You Must Reassure Through Real Recognition</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a
cooperative team.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pat on the back goes a long way, specially when it's done publicly. But
reassuring is not just about rewarding but building trust and cooperation.</p>
<p>Everyone likes to feel like they're winning and getting validation for their
good work. Many software development managers are introverts who struggle with
giving compliments.</p>
<p>I think that more than a skill that can be learned, you need to be constantly
aware of opportunities to provide recognitions (this is harder than it sounds).</p>
<p>I have worked for companies that had free-pizza events (or insert another snack
here) to celebrate team achievements. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Celebration is necessary for a team to function. However, some organisations
tend to over-characterise such acts as proof of their generosity and
reassurance that employees are doing a good job.</p>
<p>I think that most employees can see through this over characterisation and that
leaves them with a bitter taste in their mouths. Without proper reassurance and
<strong>true</strong> recognition, it doesn't matter how many pizza events there are, people
won't feel reassured and valued in their job.</p>
<p>It might even be the opposite: &quot;why is the company going a long way with such
events whereas people aren't getting paid enough?&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses">panem et
circenses</a></p>
<p>One of the best kinds of recognition is the financial one, specially when that
financial acknowledgement is made proactively from the manager-side before
&quot;official&quot; raise ceremonies take place.</p>
<p>It might be harder to give financial recognition in start-up companies
struggling for cash. There are other means to account for that like granting
share options or title promotions.</p>
<p>However, navigate the &quot;title promotion&quot; situation with care. Although such
promotions are a good way to recognise the work that someone has done, they can
also be a problem. Eagerly promoting people who aren't ready for the role as a
retention strategy can backfire. This is <strong>not</strong> true recognition.</p>
<p>It is incredible that in certain places salary raises only happen once a
year. If you missed the date but got a lot of responsibility on your back,
you need to perform the role for a year without financial recognition.</p>
<p>It is very hard to be a manager in such companies as you don't have freedom to
<em>really</em> manage your team.</p>
<h2>You must keep an open mind about your management skills</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The same divisive effect occurs in connection with the so-called “leadership
training courses,” which are (although carried out without any such intention
by many of their organizers) in the last analysis alienating. These courses
are based on the naïve assumption that one can promote the community by
training its leaders—as if it were the parts that promote the whole and not
the whole which, in being promoted, promotes the parts.</p>
<p>Paulo Freire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Managing is hard, and there is so much material out there that isn't necessary
relevant or particularly useful to <strong>your</strong> situation.</p>
<p>From that, it is easy to grow cynical thinking that &quot;no one can teach
management&quot;. But that is also not a helpful way to see things. I bet your
reports would raise an eyebrow if you said that to them.</p>
<p>Material on how to manage <strong>creative workers</strong> like software developers seems
particularly scarce. The creative-types also seem to require a different
kind of management than the general &quot;KPI-based&quot; literature teaches.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, there is usually not many clear metrics you can track on
how much impact a creative has made (usually in terms of revenue) to the
business. Of course you should be able to tell whether someone is performing to
the level of their role, but overall impact is a harder thing to measure.</p>
<p>For example, you might have productive developers that look good on paper but
aren't generating tons of concrete value. They may, at the same time, demand a
lot of resources from across the team for code review.</p>
<p>In the same way, you might have workers that seem slower but always provide
high-quality and impactful changes (and feedback) that are aligned with
core-business values.</p>
<p>These situations are tricky. Part of growing as a manager is recognising those
types of workers exist and providing feedback that enables them both to grow.</p>
<p>Even though improving-as-a-manager is a slow process and difficult in a
different way than improving-as-a-developer, progressive improvement is
possible.</p>
<p>Managing takes a different source of energy than coding. If you are not a real
people person you have to be prepared to spend more time and energy being a
manager.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, it's already very hard to keep on top of these &quot;5 musts&quot;,
specially as the number of reports goes up.</p>
<p>The final advice here is to keep an open mind. Check the literature and try and
read some books on management. Observe how your team members interact with
each other and listen to what they have to say. Learn from teams that perform
well, and from teams that don't perform well. What are the differences? Read
other posts like this one about what other managers are thinking and think
critically about what you read. Don't take our word for it!</p>
<p>Some recommendations for reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Culture Map (Erin Meyer)</li>
<li>Peopleware (Tom DeMarco)</li>
<li>Ruined by Design (Mike Monteiro)</li>
<li>The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>Even after writing about all of these topics, I myself am not able to perform
these advices to the dot every single day.</p>
<p>If not by an act of human fallibility, in some situations it is just not
possible to follow general advice. I think that this is OK.</p>
<p>What matters the most is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantly learning and taking active interested in how to be better at
management.</li>
<li>Checking whether you'd like someone to manage you the way you manage your
team.</li>
<li>Critically thinking about management and leadership decisions.</li>
<li>Keeping track of progress!</li>
</ul>
