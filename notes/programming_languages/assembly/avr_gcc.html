<blockquote>
<p>AVR-GCC is a compiler that takes C language high level code and creates a
binary source which can be uploaded into an AVR micro controller. Thus
AVR-GCC might be regarded as a 'C' cross compiler for producing AVR code.
AVR-libc are 'C' run-time libraries, header files, and documentation
primarily for the AVR target and are used in conjunction with AVR-GCC .
Please note that AVR-libc and AVRLIB are different sets of libraries but both
work with the AVR-GCC compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once code in 'C' is written for a particular project AVR-GCC will turn C code
into assembly language files. AVR-libc includes all the header files that
contain the addresses of port and register names, the floating point library,
AVR-specific macros, and AVR start-up code. It also provides a lot of
documentation, both on the library items itself as well as on a number of
general items on the entire tool chain, including a FAQ.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Individual assembler files are then converted into object files. Object files
are files of code that AVR chips could run. The linker AVR-ld will take all
these assembler files, and cross-reference functions names to create one
single object file. The linker will also take modules from the 'C' library
and make them into a single object. Normally this linked object is in ELF
format and furthermore AVR-objcopy is used to generate a HEX format file.</p>

<p>My primary motivation for using <code>avr-gcc</code> at the moment is for compiling
assembly to an Arduino Uno using ATMega328p.</p>
<p>The building process of an assembly file through avr-gcc is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The assembly file goes through the preprocessor, where all macros are
evaluated, and comments are removed.</li>
<li>The assembly code needs to be converted to an object/elf file. This file is
generated by an <em>assembler</em>. This type of file holds the opcode for the
particular architecture along with the data for the program (strings,
constants, etc.), plus some other metadata.</li>
<li>Your code may require code from other libraries, or from other files. A
<em>linker</em> will link all of the necessary files into a single program with an
obvious entry point.</li>
<li>This program now gets converted to a HEX file, which will transform the
previous file with all opcodes into something that can be uploaded directly
to the flash.</li>
</ol>
<p>The avr-gcc compiler also includes the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembler: avr-as</li>
<li>Linker: avr-ld</li>
<li>Section and program sizes: avr-size</li>
<li>Object file management: avr-objcopy and avr-objdump</li>
</ul>
