<h1>Bullshit Jobs Review</h0>
<pre><code class="language-">
Created at: 2025-08-01
</code></pre><p>It took me so long to finish this book as I was reading other books at the same time, which is surprising for such a short book! Fair to say it fell into the category of books that I read but didn't really pay full attention to. Nonetheless, the ideas are simple and appealing, so the book was easy to follow even though I was reading it between many days of interruptions in between.</p>
<p>It seems like some of the statistics presented by the author have been disputed, mainly:</p>
<blockquote>Although we find that the perception of doing useless work is strongly</blockquote>
<blockquote>associated with poor wellbeing, our findings contradict the main propositions</blockquote>
<blockquote>of Graeber’s theory. The proportion of employees describing their jobs as</blockquote>
<blockquote>useless is low and declining and bears little relationship to Graeber’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>predictions. Marx’s concept of alienation and a ‘Work Relations’ approach</blockquote>
<blockquote>provide inspiration for an alternative account that highlights poor</blockquote>
<blockquote>management and toxic workplace environments in explaining why workers</blockquote>
<blockquote>perceive paid work as useless.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>https://doi.org/10.1177%2F09500170211015067</blockquote>
<p>But also defended, mainly:</p>
<blockquote>Quantitative research on Europe, however, finds little support for Graeber’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>theory and claims that alienation may be better suited to explain why people</blockquote>
<blockquote>consider their jobs socially useless. This study extends previous analyses by</blockquote>
<blockquote>drawing on a rich, under-utilized dataset and provides new evidence for the</blockquote>
<blockquote>United States specifically. Contrary to previous studies, it thus finds</blockquote>
<blockquote>robust support for Graeber’s theory on bullshit jobs. At the same time, it</blockquote>
<blockquote>also confirms existing evidence on the effects of various other factors,</blockquote>
<blockquote>including alienation.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>https://doi.org/10.1177%2F09500170231175771</blockquote>
<p>Statistics apart, some ideas provide food for thought. The central points are abut 5 different types of bullshit jobs:</p>
<ol><li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store greeters;</li><li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, or to prevent other goons from doing so, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists;</li><li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm passengers with lost luggage;</li><li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in<ul><li>house magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, academic administration;</li><li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it, e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li></ol>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">source</a></li></ul>
<p>And the book ends with a recommendation that UBI (universal basic income) could help out alleviate the number of bullshit jobs in society.</p>
<h2>Quotations</h0>
<blockquote>Provisional Definition: a bullshit job is a form of employment that is so</blockquote>
<blockquote>completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee</blockquote>
<blockquote>cannot justify its existence.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>As Socrates teaches us, when this happens—when our own definitions produce</blockquote>
<blockquote>results that seem intuitively wrong to us—it’s because we’re not aware of</blockquote>
<blockquote>what we really think.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>I don’t think I know anyone who has had the same job for thirty years or more</blockquote>
<blockquote>who doesn’t feel that the bullshit quotient has increased over the time he or</blockquote>
<blockquote>she has been doing it. I might add that this is certainly true of my own work</blockquote>
<blockquote>as a professor.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>Sigmund Freud even spoke of “housewife’s neurosis”: a condition that he</blockquote>
<blockquote>believed affected women forced to limit their life horizons to tidying up</blockquote>
<blockquote>after others, and who therefore became fanatical about domestic hygiene as a</blockquote>
<blockquote>form of revenge. This is often the moral agony of the duct taper: to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>forced to organize one’s working life around caring about a certain value</blockquote>
<blockquote>(say, cleanliness) precisely because more important people could not care</blockquote>
<blockquote>less.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>Peasants and servants obviously were expected to work more steadily. But even</blockquote>
<blockquote>so, their work schedule was nothing remotely as regular or disciplined as the</blockquote>
<blockquote>current nine-to-five—the typical medieval serf, male or female, probably</blockquote>
<blockquote>worked from dawn to dusk for twenty to thirty days out of any year, but just</blockquote>
<blockquote>a few hours a day otherwise, and on feast days, not at all. And feast days</blockquote>
<blockquote>were not infrequent.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>Clarence: I worked as a museum guard for a major global security company in a</blockquote>
<blockquote>museum where one exhibition room was left unused more or less permanently. My</blockquote>
<blockquote>job was to guard that empty room, ensuring no museum guests touched the …</blockquote>
<blockquote>well, nothing in the room, and ensure nobody set any fires. To keep my mind</blockquote>
<blockquote>sharp and attention undivided, I was forbidden any form of mental</blockquote>
<blockquote>stimulation, like books, phones, etc</blockquote>
<blockquote>Since nobody was ever there, in practice I sat still and twiddled my thumbs</blockquote>
<blockquote>for seven and a half hours, waiting for the fire alarm to sound. If it did, I</blockquote>
<blockquote>was to calmly stand up and walk out. That was it.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>The field of value is always contested territory. It seems that whenever</blockquote>
<blockquote>there’s a word for something everyone agrees to be desirable—“truth,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“beauty,” “love,” “democracy”—then there will be no consensus as to what it</blockquote>
<blockquote>really means. (Oddly enough, this is even true of money: economists are</blockquote>
<blockquote>divided over what it is.)</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>software engineering work was divided between the interesting and challenging</blockquote>
<blockquote>work of developing core technologies, and the tedious labor of “applying duct</blockquote>
<blockquote>tape” to allow different core technologies to work together, because the</blockquote>
<blockquote>designers had never bothered to think about their compatibility. His main</blockquote>
<blockquote>point, though, was that, increasingly, open source means that all the really</blockquote>
<blockquote>engaging tasks are done for free:</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>Pablo: Where two decades ago, companies dismissed open source software and</blockquote>
<blockquote>developed core technologies in-house, nowadays companies rely heavily on open</blockquote>
<blockquote>source and employ software developers almost entirely to apply duct tape on</blockquote>
<blockquote>core technologies they get for free. In the end, you can see people doing the</blockquote>
<blockquote>nongratifying duct-taping work during office hours and then doing gratifying</blockquote>
<blockquote>work on core technologies during the night. This leads to an interesting</blockquote>
<blockquote>vicious circle: given that people choose to work on core technologies for</blockquote>
<blockquote>free, no company is investing in those technologies. The underinvestment</blockquote>
<blockquote>means that the core technologies are often unfinished, lacking quality, have</blockquote>
<blockquote>a lot of rough edges, bugs, etc. That, in turn, creates need for duct tape</blockquote>
<blockquote>and thus proliferation of duct-taping jobs.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>the greater the social value produced by a job, the less one is likely to be</blockquote>
<blockquote>paid to do it. Like Annie, they are faced with the choice between doing</blockquote>
<blockquote>useful and important work like taking care of children but being effectively</blockquote>
<blockquote>told that the gratification of helping others should be its own reward</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>Candi: Let me give an example. Recently I was thinking maybe I’d foster a</blockquote>
<blockquote>kid. So I looked into the package. It’s quite generous. You get a council</blockquote>
<blockquote>flat, and on top of that you get £250 a week to look after the child. But</blockquote>
<blockquote>then I realized: wait a minute. They’re talking about £13,000 a year and an</blockquote>
<blockquote>apartment, for one child. Which the child’s parents in probably most cases</blockquote>
<blockquote>didn’t have. If we’d just given the same thing to the parents so they didn’t</blockquote>
<blockquote>get into so many problems they’d never have had to foster the child to begin</blockquote>
<blockquote>with.</blockquote>
