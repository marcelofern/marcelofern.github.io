<h1>Thoughts On Management</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-09-01
</code></pre>
<p>I have been managing people for the past 3 years at my current job. This is
not extensive experience and I still see myself as a junior manager at best.</p>
<p>However, I have put some thought on lessons that I have learnt on my way and
reoccurring patterns that have made my job easier (or more difficult in certain
cases), and I think that some of these tips would've helped greatly at the
beginning.</p>
<p>The overall management style I have been applying, and that has also been
successfully applied <strong>to me</strong> by some of my managers, can be summarised in 5
<strong>must's</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You must facilitate.</li>
<li>You must listen.</li>
<li>You must take an active interest in the development of your employees.</li>
<li>You must reassure.</li>
<li>You must keep an open mind about your management skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having the &quot;personality of it&quot; or some innate charisma would be of great help,
but it is not strictly necessary as long as you are open to work on it.</p>
<h2>You Must Facilitate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible
for people to work.” ― Tom DeMarco, Peopleware</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being promoted as a manager after performing well as a software developer is a
regular occurrence of our times. Another regular occurrence is for a former
developer to become a bad manager.</p>
<p>The Venn intersection between skills required to be a developer and be a
manager is a narrow one.</p>
<p>My first challenge stepping into the role for the first time was to manage my
own conflicts of interest. I wanted to continue develop my knack for coding as
I deemed my individual contributor skills more important than management and
leadership skills. That meant that I wasn't facilitating much and the lack of
leadership and direction was tampering the development of my team.</p>
<p>Once my team grew to about ~7 developers I realised that what I was doing was
unsustainable. I wasn't having enough time to spend on quality coding and R&amp;D,
because I was spending time on management duties, and I was also not helping
unblock my team's work as I was spending too much time coding. My stress levels
raised and I had to step back and re-approach the problem.</p>
<h2>You Must Reassure</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a
cooperative team.” ― Tom DeMarco, Peopleware</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>You must keep an open mind about your management skills.</h2>
<p>Having the &quot;personality of it&quot; or innate charisma would be of great help on
performing management duty, but it is not strictly necessary as long as you are
open to work on it.</p>
