<h1>Never Split The Difference</h0>
<pre><code class="language-">
Created at: 2024-12-20

<p>I know zero about negotiation. At least technically.</p>
<p>This book is a good introduction for people like me as it goes through a lot of basic examples and common mistakes people make during negotiations.</p>
<p>The author provides some good points through anecdotes and past experiences. Some stories are entertaining, but one could say they make the book more unnecessarily verbose for the actual content in it.</p>
<p>In summary, this book reads more like the advice on a specialist, rather than a thorough scientific analysis of the subject. I think that this approach suits the topic well.</p>
<h2>Other readings that are relevant on negotiation:</h0>
<ul><li><a href="https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/">Rules for negotiating an offer (2016)</a></li><li><a href="https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/">How to not bomb your offer negotiation (2016)</a></li></ul>
<h2>Summary Of The Summary</h0>
<p>These are the main points, though their justifications are lacking.</p>
<ul><li>Separate the person (the emotion) from the problem.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Don't get wrapped up on what they are asking for. Focus on "why" they are asking for it. What are their ulterior motives?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ask open</li><li>ended questions to make your counterpart solve your problem for you. For example "How am I supposed to do that?"</li></ul>
<ul><li>Keep a calm and deep voice that shows you are in control. Don't sound too direct or confrontational. Keep a soft smile and make your tone of voice convey the sentiment of "help me understand".</li></ul>
<ul><li>Mirror questions to disagree without being disagreeable. "I will pay you a fair amount of money for this", mirror: "Fair?" Or "I'm sorry, fair?". Wait for 4 seconds patiently, as the person will be moved to explain further.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Don't ask questions that invite further negotiation. Focus on "What" and "How" questions instead of "Does" and "Do".</li></ul>
<ul><li>Labelling invites people to expand their thoughts. Pause for 4 seconds after labelling to allow the other party to elaborate.</li><li>It seems like _________ is valuable to you.</li><li>It seems like you don’t like _________.</li><li>It seems like you value __________.</li><li>It seems like _________ makes it easier.</li><li>It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Drive the negotiation to a point where your counterpart says "that's right" which means they are confident you understood their problems, instead of a "you're right" which can in many times introduce an initial withdrawal.</li></ul>
<ul><li>When talking about numbers, use odd numbers. They look more serious. For example, $98,721 seems to be thought</li><li>out, whereas $98,000 seems to have been a guess or estimation.</li></ul>
<ul><li>When negotiating salary, if forced to answer a number, give a range instead. The range should be one where your required salary is on the lowest end.</li></ul>
<h2>Labelling statements</h0>
<blockquote>There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation</blockquote>
<blockquote>to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation:</blockquote>
<ul><li>It seems like _________ is valuable to you.</li><li>It seems like you don’t like _________.</li><li>It seems like you value __________.</li><li>It seems like _________ makes it easier.</li><li>It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.</li></ul>
<h2>Calibrating questions</h0>
<blockquote>There will be a small group of “What” and “How” questions that you will find</blockquote>
<blockquote>yourself using in nearly every situation. Here are a few of them:</blockquote>
<ul><li>What are we trying to accomplish?</li><li>How is that worthwhile?</li><li>What’s the core issue here?</li><li>How does that affect things?</li><li>What’s the biggest challenge you face?</li><li>How does this fit into what the objective is?</li></ul>

<h2>My Highlights</h0>
<blockquote>I was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most potent negotiating</blockquote>
<blockquote>tools: the open-ended question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(people place greater value on moving from 90 percent to 100 percent—high</blockquote>
<blockquote>probability to certainty—than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though</blockquote>
<blockquote>they’re both ten percentage points).</blockquote>
<blockquote>One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; two, don’t get wrapped</blockquote>
<blockquote>up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus</blockquote>
<blockquote>on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they</blockquote>
<blockquote>really want;</blockquote>
<blockquote>God knows aiming low is seductive. Self-esteem is a huge factor in</blockquote>
<blockquote>negotiation, and many people set modest goals to protect it. It’s easier to</blockquote>
<blockquote>claim victory when you aim low. That’s why some negotiation experts say that</blockquote>
<blockquote>many people who think they have “win-win” goals really have a “wimp-win”</blockquote>
<blockquote>mentality. The “wimp-win” negotiator focuses on his or her bottom line, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>that’s where they end up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific,</blockquote>
<blockquote>challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who</blockquote>
<blockquote>don’t set goals or simply strive to do their best.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in nearly every situation</blockquote>
<blockquote>to extract information from your counterpart, or defuse an accusation:</blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems like _________ is valuable to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems like you don’t like _________.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems like you value __________.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems like _________ makes it easier.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>As an example, if you’re trying to renegotiate an apartment lease to allow</blockquote>
<blockquote>subletters and you know the landlord is opposed to them, your prepared labels</blockquote>
<blockquote>would be on the lines of “It seems as though you’re not a fan of subletters”</blockquote>
<blockquote>or “It seems like you want stability with your tenants.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has a great quote that sums up this</blockquote>
<blockquote>concept: “You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality</blockquote>
<blockquote>is up for negotiation, that we think it’s whatever you say it is. You must</blockquote>
<blockquote>accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>There will be a small group of “What” and “How” questions that you will find</blockquote>
<blockquote>yourself using in nearly every situation. Here are a few of them:</blockquote>
<blockquote>What are we trying to accomplish?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How is that worthwhile?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the core issue here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How does that affect things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the biggest challenge you face?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How does this fit into what the objective is?</blockquote>
<blockquote>QUESTIONS TO USE TO UNEARTH THE DEAL-KILLING ISSUES</blockquote>
<blockquote>What are we up against here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What is the biggest challenge you face?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How does making a deal with us affect things?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What happens if you do nothing?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What does doing nothing cost you? How does making this deal resonate with</blockquote>
<blockquote>what your company prides itself on?</blockquote>
<blockquote>When deliberating on a negotiating strategy or approach, people tend to focus</blockquote>
<blockquote>all their energies on what to say or do, but it’s how we are (our general</blockquote>
<blockquote>demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most</blockquote>
<blockquote>immediately effective mode of influence. Our brains don’t just process and</blockquote>
<blockquote>understand the actions and words of others but their feelings and intentions</blockquote>
<blockquote>too, the social meaning of their behavior and their emotions. On a mostly</blockquote>
<blockquote>unconscious level, we can understand the minds of others not through any kind</blockquote>
<blockquote>of thinking but through quite literally grasping what the other is feeling.</blockquote>
<blockquote>That’s why your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone’s brain and flip</blockquote>
<blockquote>an emotional switch. Distrusting to trusting. Nervous to calm. In an instant,</blockquote>
<blockquote>the switch will flip just like that with the right delivery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are essentially three voice tones available to negotiators: the</blockquote>
<blockquote>late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful voice, and the direct or</blockquote>
<blockquote>assertive voice. Forget the assertive voice for now; except in very rare</blockquote>
<blockquote>circumstances, using it is like slapping yourself in the face while you’re</blockquote>
<blockquote>trying to make progress. You’re signaling dominance onto your counterpart,</blockquote>
<blockquote>who will either aggressively, or passive-aggressively, push back against</blockquote>
<blockquote>attempts to be controlled. Most of the time, you should be using the</blockquote>
<blockquote>positive/playful voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile</blockquote>
<blockquote>while you’re talking. A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact</blockquote>
<blockquote>tonally that the other person will pick up on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I’m in control. When you</blockquote>
<blockquote>inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you’ve brought</blockquote>
<blockquote>in a measure of uncertainty. You’ve made a statement sound like a question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You’ve left the door open for the other guy to take the lead, so I was</blockquote>
<blockquote>careful here to be quiet, self-assured.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a</blockquote>
<blockquote>tone of voice that says I’m okay, you’re okay, let’s figure things out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is when you repeat the</blockquote>
<blockquote>last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has</blockquote>
<blockquote>just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set,</blockquote>
<blockquote>mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet</blockquote>
<blockquote>uncannily effective. By repeating back what people say, you trigger this</blockquote>
<blockquote>mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was</blockquote>
<blockquote>just said and sustain the process of connecting. Psychologist Richard Wiseman</blockquote>
<blockquote>created a study using waiters to identify what was the more effective method</blockquote>
<blockquote>of creating a connection with strangers: mirroring or positive reinforcement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>One group of waiters, using positive reinforcement, lavished praise and</blockquote>
<blockquote>encouragement on patrons using words such as “great,” “no problem,” and</blockquote>
<blockquote>“sure” in response to each order. The other group of waiters mirrored their</blockquote>
<blockquote>customers simply by repeating their orders back to them. The results were</blockquote>
<blockquote>stunning: the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more</blockquote>
<blockquote>than of those who used positive reinforcement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I only half-jokingly refer to mirroring as magic or a Jedi mind trick because</blockquote>
<blockquote>it gives you the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up</blockquote>
<blockquote>with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily,</blockquote>
<blockquote>there’s another way without all the mess. It’s just four simple steps:</blockquote>
<blockquote>1.Use the late-night FM DJ voice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>2.Start with “I’m sorry . . .”</blockquote>
<blockquote>3.Mirror.</blockquote>
<blockquote>4.Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>5.Repeat.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and you’re likely to incite</blockquote>
<blockquote>irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you</blockquote>
<blockquote>want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three</blockquote>
<blockquote>words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different and are drawn</blockquote>
<blockquote>to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which</blockquote>
<blockquote>facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and</blockquote>
<blockquote>bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and</blockquote>
<blockquote>encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give</blockquote>
<blockquote>someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person</blockquote>
<blockquote>feels.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Labeling is a helpful tactic in de-escalating angry confrontations, because</blockquote>
<blockquote>it makes the person acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act</blockquote>
<blockquote>out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often</blockquote>
<blockquote>more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the</blockquote>
<blockquote>barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them</blockquote>
<blockquote>credence; get them into the open.</blockquote>
<blockquote>List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them</blockquote>
<blockquote>before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance</blockquote>
<blockquote>prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because</blockquote>
<blockquote>these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will</blockquote>
<blockquote>encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’ll let you in on a secret. There are actually three kinds of “Yes”:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment. A counterfeit “yes” is one in</blockquote>
<blockquote>which your counterpart plans on saying “no” but either feels “yes” is an</blockquote>
<blockquote>easier escape route or just wants to disingenuously keep the conversation</blockquote>
<blockquote>going to obtain more information or some other kind of edge. A confirmation</blockquote>
<blockquote>“yes” is generally innocent, a reflexive response to a black-or-white</blockquote>
<blockquote>question; it’s sometimes used to lay a trap but mostly it’s just simple</blockquote>
<blockquote>affirmation with no promise of action. And a commitment “yes” is the real</blockquote>
<blockquote>deal; it’s a true agreement that leads to action, a “yes” at the table that</blockquote>
<blockquote>ends with a signature on the contract. The commitment “yes” is what you want,</blockquote>
<blockquote>but the three types sound almost the same so you have to learn how to</blockquote>
<blockquote>recognize which one is being used.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I tell my students that, if you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to</blockquote>
<blockquote>talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a</blockquote>
<blockquote>request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Good negotiators welcome—even invite—a solid “No” to start, as a sign that</blockquote>
<blockquote>the other party is engaged and thinking. Gun for a “Yes” straight off the</blockquote>
<blockquote>bat, though, and your counterpart gets defensive, wary, and skittish. That’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>why I tell my students that, if you’re trying to sell something, don’t start</blockquote>
<blockquote>with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to</blockquote>
<blockquote>talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a</blockquote>
<blockquote>request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so</blockquote>
<blockquote>trigger it. By saying what they don’t want, your counterpart defines their</blockquote>
<blockquote>space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That’s why “Is</blockquote>
<blockquote>now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to</blockquote>
<blockquote>talk?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right”</blockquote>
<blockquote>in a negotiation creates breakthroughs. Use a summary to trigger a</blockquote>
<blockquote>“that’s right.” The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined</blockquote>
<blockquote>with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world</blockquote>
<blockquote>according to . . .”</blockquote>
<blockquote>A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband</blockquote>
<blockquote>doesn’t want to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise,</blockquote>
<blockquote>they meet halfway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>To make my point on compromise, let me paint you an example: A woman wants</blockquote>
<blockquote>her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn’t want</blockquote>
<blockquote>to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they meet</blockquote>
<blockquote>halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this</blockquote>
<blockquote>the best outcome? No! In fact, that’s the worst possible outcome. Either of</blockquote>
<blockquote>the two other outcomes—black or brown—would be better than the compromise.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. The simple</blockquote>
<blockquote>passing of time and its sharper cousin, the deadline, are the screw that</blockquote>
<blockquote>pressures every deal to a conclusion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever</blockquote>
<blockquote>trigger the consequences we think—or are told—they will.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can play into your</blockquote>
<blockquote>hands. Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the</blockquote>
<blockquote>month, when their transactions are assessed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their</blockquote>
<blockquote>deadline, they get better deals. It’s true. First, by revealing your cutoff</blockquote>
<blockquote>you reduce the risk of impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your</blockquote>
<blockquote>deadline, he’ll get to the real deal- and concession-making more quickly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’ve got one final point to make before we move on: Deadlines are almost</blockquote>
<blockquote>never ironclad. What’s more important is engaging in the process and having a</blockquote>
<blockquote>feel for how long that will take. You may see that you have more to</blockquote>
<blockquote>accomplish than time will actually allow before the clock runs out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the Ultimatum Game, years of experience has shown me that most accepters</blockquote>
<blockquote>will invariably reject any offer that is less than half of the proposer’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>money. Once you get to a quarter of the proposer’s money you can forget it</blockquote>
<blockquote>and the accepters are insulted. Most people make an irrational choice to let</blockquote>
<blockquote>the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer,</blockquote>
<blockquote>because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive</blockquote>
<blockquote>rational value of the money.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Negotiations were getting down to the wire and the NFL Players Association</blockquote>
<blockquote>(NFLPA) said that before they agreed to a final deal they wanted the owners</blockquote>
<blockquote>to open their books. The owners’ answer? “We’ve given the players a fair</blockquote>
<blockquote>offer.” Notice the horrible genius of this: instead of opening their books or</blockquote>
<blockquote>declining to do so, the owners shifted the focus to the NFLPA’s supposed lack</blockquote>
<blockquote>of understanding of fairness. If you find yourself in this situation, the</blockquote>
<blockquote>best reaction is to simply mirror the “F” that has just been lobbed at you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Fair?” you’d respond, pausing to let the word’s power do to them as it was</blockquote>
<blockquote>intended to do to you. Follow that with a label: “It seems like you’re ready</blockquote>
<blockquote>to provide the evidence that supports that,” which alludes to opening their</blockquote>
<blockquote>books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their</blockquote>
<blockquote>claim to fairness or give you more data to work with than you had previously.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Right away, you declaw the attack.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it’s positive and</blockquote>
<blockquote>constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation. Here’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>how I use it: Early on in a negotiation, I say, “I want you to feel like you</blockquote>
<blockquote>are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you</blockquote>
<blockquote>feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.” It’s simple and clear and sets</blockquote>
<blockquote>me up as an honest dealer. With that statement, I let people know it is okay</blockquote>
<blockquote>to use that word with me if they use it honestly. As a negotiator, you should</blockquote>
<blockquote>strive for a reputation of being fair. Your reputation precedes you. Let it</blockquote>
<blockquote>precede you in a way that paves success.</blockquote>
<blockquote>let me leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion: In a tough</blockquote>
<blockquote>negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the</blockquote>
<blockquote>thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they</blockquote>
<blockquote>have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When confronted with naming your terms or price, counter by recalling a</blockquote>
<blockquote>similar deal which establishes your “ballpark,” albeit the best possible</blockquote>
<blockquote>ballpark you wish to be in. Instead of saying, “I’m worth $110,000,” Jerry</blockquote>
<blockquote>might have said, “At top places like X Corp., people in this job get between</blockquote>
<blockquote>$130,000 and $170,000.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>In a recent study,4 Columbia Business School psychologists found that job</blockquote>
<blockquote>applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries</blockquote>
<blockquote>than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a “bolstering</blockquote>
<blockquote>range,” in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Understand, if you offer a range (and it’s a good idea to do so) expect them</blockquote>
<blockquote>to come in at the low end.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel</blockquote>
<blockquote>like temporary placeholders, guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated</blockquote>
<blockquote>off of. But anything you throw out that sounds less rounded—say,</blockquote>
<blockquote>$37,263—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful</blockquote>
<blockquote>calculation. Such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart, so</blockquote>
<blockquote>use them to fortify your offers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the</blockquote>
<blockquote>other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops</blockquote>
<blockquote>the F-bomb, don’t get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to</blockquote>
<blockquote>explain how you’re mistreating them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do</blockquote>
<blockquote>impulsive things that are against their best interests.</blockquote>
<blockquote>First off, calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like “can,” “is,” “are,”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“do,” or “does.” These are closed-ended questions that can be answered with a</blockquote>
<blockquote>simple “yes” or a “no.” Instead, they start with a list of words people know</blockquote>
<blockquote>as reporter’s questions: “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively. But</blockquote>
<blockquote>let me cut the list even further: it’s best to start with “what,” “how,” and</blockquote>
<blockquote>sometimes “why.” Nothing else. “Who,” “when,” and “where” will often just get</blockquote>
<blockquote>your counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And “why” can backfire.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Regardless of what language the word “why” is translated into, it’s</blockquote>
<blockquote>accusatory. There are very rare moments when this is to your advantage. The</blockquote>
<blockquote>only time you can use “why” successfully is when the defensiveness that is</blockquote>
<blockquote>created supports the change you are trying to get them to see. “Why would you</blockquote>
<blockquote>ever change from the way you’ve always done things and try my approach?” is</blockquote>
<blockquote>an example. “Why would your company ever change from your long-standing</blockquote>
<blockquote>vendor and choose our company?” is another. As always, tone of voice,</blockquote>
<blockquote>respectful and deferential, is critical.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Having just two words to start with might not seem like a lot of ammunition,</blockquote>
<blockquote>but trust me, you can use “what” and “how” to calibrate nearly any question.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Does this look like something you would like?” can become “How does this</blockquote>
<blockquote>look to you?” or “What about this works for you?” You can even ask, “What</blockquote>
<blockquote>about this doesn’t work for you?” and you’ll probably trigger quite a bit of</blockquote>
<blockquote>useful information from your counterpart.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation,</blockquote>
<blockquote>depending on the situation:</blockquote>
<blockquote>- What about this is important to you?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- How can I help to make this better for us?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- How would you like me to proceed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- What is it that brought us into this situation?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- How can we solve this problem?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?</blockquote>
<blockquote>- How am I supposed to do that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>The implication of any well-designed calibrated question is that you want</blockquote>
<blockquote>what the other guy wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the</blockquote>
<blockquote>problem. This really appeals to very aggressive or egotistical counterparts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You’ve not only implicitly asked for help—triggering goodwill and less</blockquote>
<blockquote>defensiveness—but you’ve engineered a situation in which your formerly</blockquote>
<blockquote>recalcitrant counterpart is now using his mental and emotional resources to</blockquote>
<blockquote>overcome your challenges. It is the first step in your counterpart</blockquote>
<blockquote>internalizing your way—and the obstacles in it—as his own. And that guides</blockquote>
<blockquote>the other party toward designing a solution. Your solution. Think back to how</blockquote>
<blockquote>the doctor used calibrated questions to get his patient to stay. As his story</blockquote>
<blockquote>showed, the key to getting people to see things your way is not to confront</blockquote>
<blockquote>them on their ideas (“You can’t leave”) but to acknowledge their ideas openly</blockquote>
<blockquote>(“I understand why you’re pissed off”) and then guide them toward solving the</blockquote>
<blockquote>problem (“What do you hope to accomplish by leaving?”).</blockquote>
