<h2 id="computational-theory-of-mind">Computational Theory of Mind</h2>
<p>From the mid 20th century onwards, cognitive science has been blasted
with theories speculating that computers would soon create - or simulate
- consciousness.</p>
<p>Advances in computer science were enormous, and the hype of being
able to simulate a brain within a computer was expected to be nothing
but a natural flow-on effect of such advances.</p>
<p>That is what most people thought. The ‘Chinese Room Argument’ (1980)
was nothing but a bucket of cold water waiting to hit those very same
cognitive scientists hyping about computer-based consciousness
simulation.</p>
<p>Although this book is not about the ‘Chinese Room Argument’ itself,
it is useful to understand how it works for the purposes of the
discussion that will follow.</p>
<h2 id="the-chinese-room-argument">The Chinese Room Argument</h2>
<p>The Chinese Room Argument goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you are a native English speaker (or whatever any other
language for that sake), but you don’t know anything about Chinese.</li>
<li>You are locked in a room with many Chinese symbols.</li>
<li>In this room, there is a book that shows you how to use these
symbols</li>
<li>Now imagine that outside of this room, some Chinese people are
sending writing sentences in Chinese.</li>
<li>There is a little hole inside one of the walls of that room that
allows those written sentences to be sent to the inside.</li>
<li>By using the instructions book, you are able to compare the Chinese
symbols in the input, and send back correct answers back through the
hole in the wall.</li>
<li>This book allows you to pass the Turing Test for understanding
Chinese, even though you don’t understand a single word of Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2010, Searle refreshes the argument and writes the following
conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I demonstrated years ago with the so-called Chinese Room Argument
that the implementation of the computer program is not by itself
sufficient for consciousness or intentionality (Searle 1980).
Computation is defined purely formally or syntactically, whereas minds
have actual mental or semantic contents, and we cannot get from
syntactical to the semantic just by having the syntactical operations
and nothing else. To put this point slightly more technically, the
notion “same implemented program” defines an equivalence class that is
specified independently of any specific physical realization. But such a
specification necessarily leaves out the biologically specific powers of
the brain to cause cognitive processes. A system, me, for example, would
not acquire an understanding of Chinese just by going through the steps
of a computer program that simulated the behaviour of a Chinese
speaker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is particularly interesting because if we try to simulate a
brain based on behaviour, i.e, by creating a computer software that
behaves like a conscious human, it does not follow that this software
will be ‘conscious’.</p>
<h2 id="ok-now-we-can-properly-start-the-book-review">Ok, now we can
properly start the book review</h2>
<p>The book goes on as Searle attempts to expose the fallacies of
different models of consciousness. Not only the computation view
described above, but also including models based on dualist views
(mental world vs physical world), materialist views, and even a model
that denies consciousness itself.</p>
<p>In the book, each chapter is marked by a different discussion about
one model. Those discussions often come accompanied by letters
containing the exchange between Searle and the author of that model, as
this author tries to defend his position.</p>
<p>Those letters are often hilarious as both ends are ‘academically
offensive’ towards each other, but they are also productive and
interesting as the reader can understand better what the corner-cases
and anomalies of a certain consciousness model are.</p>
<p>The book ends with Searle’s account of which direction should be
taken if we want to improve our knowledge about consciousness. He’s
obviously advocating for a deeper understanding of the biological
phenomena that happens in the brain. As much as “digestion” is a
biological phenomena, and can be studied as a process that culminates in
absorption of nutrients, the brain can be studied as a biological
machine that develops sentience.</p>
