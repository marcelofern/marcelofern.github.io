<h1>FKs Without Downtime</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-10-29
</code></pre>
<p>In order to create a foreign key in an existing table without downtime, a few
extra operations are necessary to ensure no application downtime will be
caused.</p>
<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>We need a schema and a table with some rows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE DATABASE fk_test_db;
-- If using psql, connect to that db:
-- \c fk_test_db

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS foo;
CREATE TABLE foo (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    int_field INT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO foo (int_field)
SELECT generate_series(1, 1000000) AS int_field;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bar;
CREATE TABLE bar (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    int_field INT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO bar (int_field)
SELECT generate_series(1, 1000000) AS int_field;

VACUUM ANALYZE foo;
VACUUM ANALYZE bar;
</code></pre>
<h2>1. Add the field</h2>
<p>Assume we want to add a foreign key in <code>foo</code> that points to a row in <code>bar</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN bar_id BIGINT NULL;
</code></pre>
<p>This operation takes an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE LOCK, but for a very short duration.
Adding a nullable field in Postgres doesn't require a full table scan starting
on version 11.</p>
<h2>2. Add an index for lookup</h2>
<p>Before we can add the constraint, we need an index to look the bar_id field up.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SET lock_timeout TO '0';
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS foo_bar_fk ON foo (bar_id);
</code></pre>
<p>This operation takes an ShareUpdateExclusiveLock. It won't block reads or
writes on the table.</p>
<p>This is important because as soon as the constraint is created, any deletion
on the <code>bar</code> table will need to look into <code>foo</code> to verify what to do next, like
cascading deletions (ON DELETE / ON UPDATE ...).</p>
<p>I've debugged Postgres source code, and the <code>RI_Fkey_restrict_del</code> trigger
ultimately calls <code>ri_restrict</code> which triggers the following query to check
that <code>foo</code> has a FK to the soon-to-be-deleted bar</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">-- x is my local user
SELECT 1 FROM ONLY &quot;public&quot;.&quot;foo&quot; x
WHERE $1 OPERATOR(pg_catalog.=) &quot;bar_id&quot;
FOR KEY SHARE OF x
</code></pre>
<p>The same happens when trying to change the <code>id</code> of an existing <code>bar</code> row.</p>
<h2>3. Add the constraint in INVALID mode.</h2>
<p>This will make the constraint only act on new inserts and updates on the table.
Existing rows (potentially violated by containing fks of rows that don't exist
any more in the referenced table), won't be checked unless they're being
updated.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">ALTER TABLE foo
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bar FOREIGN KEY (bar_id)
REFERENCES bar (id)
DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
NOT VALID;
</code></pre>
<p>This operation will take a ShareRowExclusive lock on <strong>both</strong> the foo table
and the bar table. This will not block reads, but it will block insert,
updates, and deletes. This will only happen for a short time, as this operation
won't need to scan the whole table.</p>
<p>Postgres implementation calls <code>ATController</code> (alter table controller) which
skips the operation <code>ATRewriteTables</code> and will only call <code>ATRewriteCatalogs</code>.
This means that <code>RI_Initial_Check</code> is never called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">/*
 * RI_Initial_Check -
 *
 * Check an entire table for non-matching values using a single query.
 * This is not a trigger procedure, but is called during ALTER TABLE
 * ADD FOREIGN KEY to validate the initial table contents.
 */
</code></pre>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>DEFERRED INITIALLY DEFERRED means the constraint won't be checked until the
end of the transaction. If necessary, This behaviour can be changed on an
transaction-per-transaction basis (via <code>SET CONSTRAINTS</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: <code>ON DELETE RESTRICT</code> can be used here, otherwise <code>NO ACTION</code> is the
default.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restricting and cascading deletes are the two most common options. RESTRICT
prevents deletion of a referenced row. NO ACTION means that if any
referencing rows still exist when the constraint is checked, an error is
raised; this is the default behavior if you do not specify anything. (The
essential difference between these two choices is that NO ACTION allows the
check to be deferred until later in the transaction, whereas RESTRICT does
not.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means if you do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">INSERT INTO foo (int_field, bar_id) values (1, 42);
DELETE FROM bar WHERE id = 42;
</code></pre>
<p>You'll get:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR:  update or delete on table &quot;bar&quot; violates foreign key constraint &quot;fk_bar&quot; on table &quot;foo&quot;
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(42) is still referenced from table &quot;foo&quot;.
</code></pre>
<h2>4. Validate The Constraint</h2>
<p>Provided there are no invalid entries in foo, i.e., no rows in foo point to
fks in bar that don't exist, you can validate the constraint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">ALTER TABLE foo VALIDATE CONSTRAINT fk_bar;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will take a ShareUpdateExclusive lock on the foo table (does
not block reads nor writes), and a RowShare lock on the bar table (does
not block reads nor writes).</p>
<p>This will call <code>RI_Initial_Check</code>, but with a weaker lock (share update excl)
called from <code>validateForeignKeyConstraint</code>.</p>
<h2>5. OPTIONAL: Set a NOT NULL constraint</h2>
<p>It might be that you never want the bar_id field to be null. In this case
there are a few extra steps you need to perform:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">-- The below still requires ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock, but doesn't require a full
-- table scan.
-- This check will only be applied to new or modified rows, existing rows
-- won't be validated because of the NOT VALID clause.
ALTER TABLE foo
ADD CONSTRAINT bar_id_not_null
CHECK (bar_id IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID;

-- The below performs a sequential scan, but without an exclusive lock.
-- Concurrent sessions can read/write.
-- The operation will require a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock, which will block
-- only other schema changes and the VACUUM operation.
-- This may take a long time, but the operation is idempotent once the
--  constraint is marked as valid.
ALTER TABLE foo VALIDATE CONSTRAINT bar_id_not_null;

-- Requires ACCESS EXCLUSIVE LOCK, but foo_not_null proves that there is no
-- NULL in this column and a full table scan is not required. Therefore, the
-- ALTER TABLE command should be fast.
-- If you are not on Postgres &gt;=12, you should skip this as it will take a lot
-- of time, and the current CHECK constraint might be good enough.
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN bar_id SET NOT NULL;

-- The CHECK constraint has fulfilled its obligation and can now departure.
-- This takes an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock, but should run very fast.
ALTER TABLE foo DROP CONSTRAINT bar_id_not_null;
