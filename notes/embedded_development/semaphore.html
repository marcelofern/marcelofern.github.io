<p>Semaphores are similar to mutexes as in they allow to control who has access to a particular resource in a scenario where multiple threads are trying to mutate shared data.</p>
<p>However, mutexes are used when only one thread can access a particular resource, whereas semaphores are more general, and allow a number N of threads (but no more) to access a particular resource.</p>
<h2>Library Analogy</h2>
<blockquote>Suppose a physical library has ten identical study rooms, to be used by one</blockquote>
<blockquote>student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk. If no</blockquote>
<blockquote>rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When a student has finished using a room, the student must return to the desk</blockquote>
<blockquote>and indicate that the room is free.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the</blockquote>
<blockquote>number of free rooms available. This requires that all of the students use</blockquote>
<blockquote>their room while they have signed up for it and return it when they are done.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When a student requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a</blockquote>
<blockquote>student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be</blockquote>
<blockquote>used for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of</blockquote>
<blockquote>time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In this scenario, the front desk count-holder represents a counting</blockquote>
<blockquote>semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent</blockquote>
<blockquote>processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially</blockquote>
<blockquote>10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room, they are granted</blockquote>
<blockquote>access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next</blockquote>
<blockquote>student comes, it drops to 8, then 7, and so on. If someone requests a room</blockquote>
<blockquote>and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until</blockquote>
<blockquote>a room is freed (when the count is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was</blockquote>
<blockquote>released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used</blockquote>
<blockquote>to select the one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking</blockquote>
<blockquote>one). And of course, a student must inform the clerk about releasing their</blockquote>
<blockquote>room only after really leaving it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as</blockquote>
<blockquote>a useful trigger for a number of different actions. The librarian above may</blockquote>
<blockquote>turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining,</blockquote>
<blockquote>or may place a sign that says the rooms are very busy when most of the rooms</blockquote>
<blockquote>are occupied.</blockquote>
