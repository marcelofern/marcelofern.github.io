<h1>Chip War Book Review</h1>
<pre><code>Created at: 2024-09-04
</code></pre>
<p>The book provides a linear view of the major achievements and discoveries in
the semiconductor industry since the advent of the transistor.</p>
<p>The book is insightful, but not technical. The narrative is presented from a
fascinating business and political perspective. The author describes important
transitions in technology along with their side-effects on the political
landscaping.</p>
<p>The book puts emphasis on the &quot;chip war&quot; that is happening behind the scenes
between global super powers.</p>
<p>This war is defined by a military race for more advanced computer chips so that
ever-more sophisticated apparatuses of mass destruction can be created for both
defence and offence.</p>
<p>The book brings urgency to the fact that the whole world depends on technology
that is concentrated among few players. Taiwan and South Korea concentrate the
production of chips, the Netherlands the advanced machinery for
photolithography, the U.S the big corporations that design, finance, and
research chips, and many Asian countries provide the human labour required for
chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>This is an elucidating reading that made me feel way more informed about the
struggles to advance the semiconductor industry than I would be if I was only
watching the news and reading sporadic articles.</p>
